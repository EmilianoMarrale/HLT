If you want the facts and figures you can (expletive deleted) have them,white
Give me your broad white hat thinking on unemployment,white
Now  give me the figures for school-leavers six months after they have left school,white
"As I said, he returned to his apartment at six-thirty in the morning because he had spent the whole night gambling",white
"Mr Jones, did you actually see the defendant gambling on the night of 30 June, or did he tell you he had been gambling",white
"No, Your Honour. But he goes gambling almost every night",white
"Mr Jones, if you were wearing the white thinking hat, what might you have said",white
I observed the defendant returning to his apartment at six-thirty in the morning on 1 July,white
Thank you. You may stand down,white
"Last year there was a twenty-five per cent increase in the sale of turkey meat in the US, due to the interest in dieting and the concern with health",white
"Mr Fitzler, I have asked you to put on your  white hat",white
"No, sir. Market research clearly shows that the reason people give for buying turkey meat is that they think it is lower in cholesterol",white
Well then you have two facts. Fact one: that turkey-meat sales have risen by twenty-five per cent in the last year. Fact two: some market research shows that people claim to buy turkey meat because of their concern with cholesterol,white
There is a rising trend in the number of women smoking cigars,white
That is not a fact,white
It is. I have the figures here,white
What your figures show is that for each of the last three years the number of women smoking cigars has risen above the level for the previous year,white
Isn’t that a trend,white
It could be. But that is an interpretation. To me a trend suggests something that is happening and will continue to happen. The figures are the fact. It may be that women are smoking more cigars because they are smoking more anyway – possibly due to increased anxiety. Or it may simply be that over the last three years cigarmakers have spent an unusual amount of money persuading women to smoke cigars. The first is a trend that could provide opportunities. The second is much less of an opportunity,white
I simply used the word  trend  to describe rising figures,white
"That may be a fair use of the word  trend , but there is  the other use with the implication of an ongoing process. So it might be better to use pure white hat thinking and say: ‘For the last three years the figures show an increase in the number of women smoking.’ Then we can discuss what this means and what it may be due to",white
I think I am right in saying that the Russian merchant fleet carries a significant part of world trade,white
I once read that the reason Japanese executives have such large expense accounts is that they give all their salary to their wives,white
I believe I am right in saying that the new Boeing 757 is much quieter than the previous generation of aircraft,white
Someone once told me that he had heard from a friend that Churchill secretly admired Hitler,white
It is Professor Schmidt’s opinion that man-powered flight will never be possible,white
By and large corporations that base their spending on extrapolated future sales run into trouble. (It is possible to point to a few companies that have done this and been successful.),white
"Sales will tend to rise if prices are lowered. (When house prices rise there may actually be increased sales for reasons of speculation, fear of inflation and fear of being left behind.)",white
"If you work hard, you will be successful in life. (A lot of hard-working people are not particularly successful.) The  spectrum of likelihood might be expressed as follows: Always true Usually true Generally true By and large More often than not About half the time Often Sometimes true Occasionally true Been known to happen Never true Cannot be true (contradictory) How far along this spectrum is it permissible to go with the white hat role",white
"Measles is usually harmless, but it can  sometimes  be followed by secondary infections, such as ear infections",white
In  very rare cases  inoculation can be followed by encephalitis,white
When irritated this breed of dog  has been known  to snap at children,white
There was a man who fell out of an aeroplane without a parachute and survived,white
Ford is said to have designed the Edsel on the basis of market research and it was a total disaster,white
"Designs based on market research can often fail. Take, for instance, the Edsel car, the design of which is said to have been based on market research",white
All the experts predict that the interest rate will fall by the end of the year,white
I talked to four experts and each of them predicted that the interest rate will fall by the end of the year,white
"I talked to Mr Flint, Mr Ziegler, Ms Cagliatto and Mr Suarez and all of them predicted that the interest rate will fall by the end of the year",white
What went wrong with our sales campaign,white
To answer that I am going to put on my white hat. We reached thirty- four per cent of retailers. Of these only sixty per cent took the product. Of those who took the product forty per cent took two items on a trial basis. Of the people we spoke to seventy per cent said the price was too high. There are two competitive products on the market with lower prices,white
Now give me your red hat thinking,white
We have a poor product which is overpriced. We have a bad image in the market. The competition’s advertising is better and there is more of it. We do not attract the best salespeople,white
Let’s start off by all putting on our white thinking hats and telling what we know about juvenile crime. What are the figures? Where are the reports,white
You have told me that you are going to order Prime computers. Could you give me your white hat thinking on that,white
I don’t want your guesses on what would happen if we lowered our transatlantic fare to two hundred and fifty dollars. I want your white hat thinking,white
You have asked for my white hat thinking on why I am changing jobs,white
I feel this is the right person for the job,red
I feel this is a risky venture,red
My intuition tells me that this explanation is too complex,red
I feel that the idea has potential,red
That idea is very interesting,red
The idea is very unusual,red
Don’t ask me why. I just don’t like this deal. It’s terrible,red
I do not like him and I don’t want to do business with him. That is all there is to it,red
I have a hunch that this bit of land behind the church is going to be worth a great deal in a few years’ time,red
That design is hideous. It will never catch on. It is a huge waste of money,red
I have a soft spot for Henry. I know he is a conman and he certainly conned us. But he did it with style. I like him,red
My gut feeling is that this deal is never going to succeed. It is bound to end in expensive litigation,red
I sense that this is a no-win situation. We are damned if we do and damned if we don’t. Let’s get out of it,red
I don’t think it is fair to withhold this information until after the deal has been signed,red
"If I were to put on my red hat, I would say that your offer could be seen as furthering your own interests rather than that of the company",red
My red hat thinking tells me you want to oppose the merger in order to preserve your job rather than to benefit the shareholders,red
"Now that we have as clear a picture of the situation as we are likely to get, let’s all put on our red thinking hats and give our emotional choice of action",red
Of the two choices – continue with the strike or negotiation – I prefer the first. I do not feel the time is right for negotiation. Neither side has been hurt enough to want to give up anything,red
I am opposing her appointment because I am jealous of her and her quick rise to power,red
"I am going to put on my red hat and I am then going to say that I feel that opposition to the promotion of Anne may be based, in part, on jealousy",red
I am going to take cover under my red hat and I am going to say that I am opposed to the promotion of Anne. It is just a feeling I have,red
There could be an element of fear here. Fear of the hassle involved in changing jobs,red
"Yes, I am very angry. And at the moment I just want to get my own back. I don’t like being cheated",red
I have to admit that I am just not happy in this job,red
Shift attention from the winner to all the losers and you will quickly see that 131 singles entrants will require 130 matches to produce 130 losers,red
I have an intuition that this electric car is just not going to sell,red
I have the feeling that he will back down when it comes to the crunch,red
I have the strong feeling that this bus ticket and that bike are the vital clues in this murder hunt,red
I have the feeling that this is not the right theory. It is too complex and messy,red
"All the reasons are against lowering the price, but my intuition tells me it is the only way to recover market share",red
Can you please red hat your intuition on this merger,red
My red hat feeling is that property prices are going to soar again quite soon,red
"Give me a red hat on this new advertising campaign, will you",red
My red hat tells me this offer is not going to be accepted,red
My feeling is that boredom is responsible for much juvenile crime,red
My feeling is that the cinema box office wants a few spectaculars that are heavily promoted,red
I am going to reach for my red thinking hat and I am going to tell you all that I do not like the way this meeting is being conducted,red
I want to make a red hat statement. I feel we are being bullied into an agreement we do not want,red
"Mr Hooper, my red hat view is that you never listen to anyone else",red
I have said what I wanted to say and now I am going to take off the red hat,red
I want you to put on your red hat and tell me what you think of my proposal,red
I suspect you don’t like me. I want a red hat answer,red
"Switching to a red hat level, I want to say that I am very pleased with the way this conference is going. Is that the general view",red
My feeling is that we all want to get this agreement settled and signed,red
"If you make any more red hat statements, I am going to put your red hat out of reach",red
"Can we have just one overall red hat statement from you, and then we’ll leave it. What do you feel about this matter",red
I want just one opportunity to make a red hat statement. Then I am going to put away that hat and not use it again,red
Don’t look at it as a defeat. Look at it as a powerful way of finding out the weaknesses and strengths of his tennis game,red
Would this offer be acceptable if it were to come as an initiative from your side,red
Write it off as an essential learning experience rather than an error in judgement. Learning is always expensive. We won’t have to go through it again,red
We all know that these negotiations are taking place against a background of extreme suspicion. Let us try to imagine what our thinking would be if each side really trusted the other side,red
There is a feeling that what we decide here is not going to make much difference. Events have taken over. Let us imagine that this is not so and that we do have it in our power to control things,red
We do have to be conscious of the background of anger that is present,red
The proposed restriction on your work for competing companies is obviously a sensitive point. We’ll keep clear of that for the moment,red
The union executive is never going to agree to anything that comes across as a wage cut. That has been expressed forcibly enough,red
The ability to cross union demarcation lines is very important to our productivity,red
We must insist that the proper disciplinary procedures be followed. We are not saying that Jones is innocent but the procedures laid down must be followed,red
I do not feel that lowering prices will actually increase sales,red
We can increase the overtime or take on more workers. The first would benefit those already working. The second would benefit some of those now out of work,red
We can raise the advertising rates and get more revenue immediately,red
"If we lower the price to attract customers from other airlines, we may get a temporary advantage. Then they will match our price and we may lose those customers again. But the lowered profitability will remain",red
"I would really enjoy eating this plateful of French fries, but it is not going to help my weight problem",red
"I am going to put money into this play because I like Nerida, who is playing the leading part, and I want to see a lot more of her",red
"I want to be seen as willing to back exciting new technology ventures, but long term I know that steady growth is what my investors want",red
Never mind why you mistrust him. You mistrust him,red
You like the idea of an office in New York. There is no need to go into the details of why you like the idea. That could come later when we are nearer to a decision on the matter,red
"I have a sense of your hesitancy on this deal. You do not want in, but you do not want to be left out either. You want to be on call in an antechamber. Ready to come in when it suits you",red
"You don’t dislike Morgan, but you feel uneasy about him. You would dearly like to have a good excuse to dislike him",red
We are simply out of tune on this matter,red
"There is a sense of quiet deflation about this venture. Not a loss of enthusiasm but rather something resembling a very slow leak in an inflated rubber dinghy. You cannot see anything happening, but when you look again after a passage of time, it is clearly more flabby than before",red
I don’t like the idea of lowering prices,black
That is red hat thinking. I want you to give me your black hat thinking. I want your logical reasons,black
"Very well. In our past experience – which I can put in front of you as sales figures – lowering prices has not resulted in sufficient sales to offset the reduction in profit margin. Also, our competitors have a history of reducing prices to match the competition",black
I can see that this idea is very attractive. We have considered all the benefits. I do think we need some black hat thinking here. We need to know the potential dangers and difficulties. What is the downside,black
We need to be aware of the possible dangers in order to be on the lookout for them. We need some black hat thinking here,black
I am all in favour of appointing Peter to this post. But it would be sensible to have some black hat thinking first,black
Sales have risen dramatically after that advertising campaign. Is there anything we need to be cautious about? Let’s have some black hat thinking,black
We both like this house very much. That is strong red hat thinking. Let’s try the black hat for a moment or two,black
"This seems an excellent idea. Let’s have a strong black hat effort to find out the weaknesses so that we can do something about those weaknesses right now, at the design stage, rather than find out about them too late",black
"We have decided on this course of action. We need to lay out all the potential problems, obstacles and difficulties so that we can plan how to overcome them. So we need the black hat",black
"That remark you made is an assumption, not a fact",black
Your conclusion does not follow from what you have been telling us,black
Those figures are not the ones you showed last time,black
That is only one possible explanation. But it is by no means the only one,black
The figures you have been given are five years old. We do not have more up-to-date figures,black
"If we increase prison sentences and penalties, we will reduce crime",black
"Holiday travel is likely to increase because family incomes are increasing, airfares are going down, travel is better organized and there may be fewer children",black
It is possible that people will get bored with travel. Technology might provide new ways of being entertained at home. Diseases in far-off places might discourage travel,black
That is indeed a possibility. But you have not proved it as a certainty,black
In times of inflation people save more,black
In times of inflation people save less,black
"After twenty years in the cosmetics business, I want to say that in my experience you cannot have the same brand both as a premium product and also a commodity product. It will not work",black
In the hotel business the same basic product can be branded differently and put in a very different price bracket. This has proved successful,black
That branding policy may hold true for hotels where you do not directly experience two products at the same time. But it might not hold true for a breakfast cereal,black
I see a danger that the competition will match our lower prices,black
I see a danger of overproduction of milk,black
I see a danger that a new company will offer no-frills insurance,black
I see a danger in overpricing our wines because many countries around the world are now producing excellent wines,black
The positive thing is that now we know how he is going to act. The uncertainty is over,yellow
Let’s put on our yellow hats and look at the positive aspects. Kodak has decided to go into the instant-camera market. So they will have to advertise their products. That will increase the public’s awareness of the merits of instant photography. That should help our sales – especially if the public perceives that our product is better,yellow
Failing that examination was the best thing that could have happened to her. She would not have been happy as a teacher,yellow
Before you do anything else I want you to put on your yellow hat and tell me what you think about this new approach,yellow
You have told me all the reasons why you do not like the idea and why it will probably fail. Now I want you to put your yellow thinking hat firmly in place. What do you see now,yellow
"From a yellow hat point of view, can you see any merit in making this fitting out of plastic instead of metal? The cost would be about the same",yellow
I have this idea of selling potato chips in a twin pack. No one seems to like it. Will you yellow hat it for me,yellow
I do not want a balanced view or an objective view. I want a definite yellow hat view,yellow
My black hat tells me that this new cheap lighter could hurt our sales,yellow
It is hard to wear a yellow hat at the moment. But the newspaper strike could make people realize how much they missed their papers and how newspapers are much better than television for some things,yellow
I am wearing my yellow thinking hat but I cannot find anything positive to say,yellow
I will put on my yellow hat but I do not expect to find anything positive,yellow
There is a remote chance that someone survived the crash-landing on the glacier. We must go and look,yellow
It is possible that this new party will split the opposition vote,yellow
"If we invest heavily in promoting this film, we should have a success on our hands",yellow
There is a chance it will be chosen car of the year. We should be prepared to follow that up in our publicity. It may not happen but we have to be ready,yellow
I know he is very busy and very expensive but get in touch with him and invite him to open the conference. He may just accept. At worst he can only say no,yellow
"Every girl wants to be an actress and only a very few succeed, so the chances of success are not great. However, some people do make it, so try if you want to",yellow
You are not likely to find any hidden art treasure in a village antique shop. But then most hidden art treasures were in places no one expected to find them,yellow
"My yellow hat thinking suggests that omelettes would make good fast- food items. If I look around for reasons to support that view, I might pick on diet consciousness and the preference for light foods. I might also say that as people tend not to have eggs for breakfast any longer, there is room to have eggs at other times",yellow
"What about a range of action gloves? Not just gloves to keep you warm but gloves for working on the car, gloves for eating with, gloves for housework. People must do more for themselves today. They are also becoming more conscious of appearance and skin care",yellow
"To improve the water supply we could build a dam on the Elkin River, thereby creating a reservoir",yellow
There is abundant water in the mountains fifty miles away. Would it be feasible to put in a pipeline,yellow
"Normal flushing toilets use about eight gallons every time they are flushed. There are new designs that use only one gallon. That could save up to thirty gallons a day per person, or nine million gallons a day",yellow
What about recycling the water? I have heard there are new membrane methods that make it economical. Also we would have less of a disposal problem. Shall I look into this,yellow
Put on your yellow hats and give me more concrete suggestions. The more we have the better,yellow
"John, what suggestion do you have? How could we tackle this problem",yellow
"Take off your black hat. Instead of assessing the proposals we have so far, put on your yellow hat and give us some more proposals",yellow
"Keeping my yellow hat on, I suggest that we let private enterprise sell water at competitive prices",yellow
"No, we are not ready to switch into black hat thinking. I do not believe that we have exhausted all possible suggestions. Yes, we do intend to bring in experts and consultants, but let us first establish some possible directions. So it’s more yellow hat constructive thinking for the moment",yellow
"If we hand over the water supply to private enterprise, there is a danger of the town being held to ransom by a monopoly supplier who establishes whatever price he likes",yellow
We could guard against that by putting a ceiling on the price. This would be related to today’s pricing with an allowance for inflation,yellow
There is a new type of fast food that is becoming popular. It is a sort of flattened chicken cooked in a Mexican style and offered as ‘polo’. Put on your yellow hat and tell me what you see in this,yellow
There are so many different types of insurance that people get confused,yellow
"In the best possible scenario, the other store is forced out of business and we take over the whole business for the area. But I do not see that this would be especially profitable. As it is, the other store is struggling",yellow
"In the best possible scenario, the interest rate rises rapidly and the value of our fixed-rate transferable mortgage makes the house very saleable",yellow
Bond prices will rise ‘if’ interest rates fall,yellow
"‘If’ fuel prices fall, big cars will become more saleable",yellow
Under what conditions would this hotel chain be profitable,yellow
"If satellite broadcasting gets established, what new opportunities is it going to offer to advertisers",yellow
"I have this vision of attractive low-cost housing, and I think I can also see how it could be done",yellow
I have this vision of a different type of economics which will handle wealth and productivity in a new way,yellow
I have this vision of thinking being taught as a fundamental subject in every school. It has already started in some countries,yellow
That glass is not half empty but is half full of whisky,yellow
More and more people need to park in cities. How can we get some value out of that,yellow
We could raise the room prices if we could attract more business travellers to this hotel. How could we do that? Let us have the usual ideas and then let us put on our green thinking hats in order to find some new ideas,yellow
Let’s have some new ideas on this. Put on your green thinking hats,green
We are bogged down. We keep going over the same old ideas. We desperately need a new approach. The time has come for some deliberate green hat thinking. Let’s go,green
You have laid out the traditional approaches to this problem. We shall come back to them. But first let us have ten minutes of green hat thinking to see if we can come up with a fresh approach,green
This demands a green hat solution,green
"Remember, I am wearing the green hat and I am therefore allowed to say things like that. That is what the green hat is for",green
I thought we were supposed to be wearing our green hat. We are being much too negative. Isn’t that black hat thinking,green
"My green hat contribution is to suggest that we pay long-stay prisoners a decent pension on their discharge. That could help them get back into society, give them something to lose and prevent them from having to go back to crime. Treat it as a provocation if you like",green
"Under the protection of the green hat, I want to suggest that we fire the sales force",green
I want you to use this idea for its movement value not its judgement value. Suppose everyone became a policeman,green
Suppose we made hamburgers square. What movement could you get out of that idea,green
Suppose there were transferable insurance bonds which one person could sell directly to another. Green hat that idea,green
Take the suggestion that everyone who wants to be promoted should wear a yellow shirt or blouse. Put on your green hat and tell me where that idea takes you,green
It leads me to think of the self-image of the person who has chosen to wear a yellow shirt. He has to live up to that image,green
It leads me to think of some way to recognize those people who have ambition but who would not be noticed for their talent. Maybe it would make more sense to train ambitious people and give them the skills,green
It leads me to think of the rules of the game. The yellow shirt would be a defined rule of the game of promotion and everyone would know it. How many employees know what they need to do to get promoted,green
It leads me to think of those people who do not want to be promoted,green
It leads me to think of a way of bringing forward the leaders. A person would need to be pretty sure of his standing with those around before he risked putting on the yellow shirt,green
Here is a suggestion for working on Saturdays and having a midweek break on Wednesday. Can you green hat it for me,green
"As no one wants to work the weekend shifts, there is a suggestion that we employ a permanent Saturday/Sunday workforce, which would be quite separate. It seems an unworkable idea but green hat it",green
Po cars should have square wheels,green
Po planes should land upside down,green
Po shoppers should be paid to buy things,green
Po executives should promote themselves,green
Po a polluting factory should be downstream of itself,green
"Shoppers usually pay for the goods they buy. Let us reverse that. Po, the store pays the customers",green
"This could lead to the trading stamp idea, which, in effect, paid shoppers a tiny amount for each purchase",green
This could lead to the idea that the tills are set up so that at every thousand dollars of input they pay out a jackpot of some sort,green
I do not see how your idea of an ‘honour system’ store could ever work because it could so easily be abused. But I am going to put on my green hat to treat it as a provocation. That leads to the idea of people adding up their own bills with random checks. Presumably mistakes would even out in each direction,green
"So we have cigarette po frog. A frog suggests hopping, so we could have a cigarette that went out after a short while. This might be of benefit in preventing fires. It could also allow a smoker to have a short smoke and then to use that cigarette later. This in turn leads to a new brand to be called  shorts , which are indeed designed to be very short and give only a two- to three- minute smoke",green
"I want some ideas to do with television sets. The random word is cheese, so television po cheese. Cheese has holes, Po the TV screen has holes",green
Our rival newspaper has just raised its price. Put on your green hat and list all our alternatives,green
"We have received a demand note saying that if we do not pay a large amount of money, our products in the stores will be poisoned. Let’s go through the obvious options open to us, then let’s put on our green thinking hats to find some further ones",green
We are going to have to decide on a location for this holiday camp. Put on your green hat and let me have all possible alternatives. Then we can narrow them down,green
How are we going to distribute these computers? What are the alternative strategies,green
"There are only three possible alternatives. We can leave the price the same. We can lower it. Or, we can raise it. There is nothing else we can do",green
What I really want to do is both to raise and lower the price at the same time. We shall create a low price commodity line and a high price premium line,green
I asked you for alternative designs for an umbrella handle and you have given me a design for a raincoat,green
You asked me for alternative ways of loading the trucks. I am going to tell you that it would make more sense to send our product by train,green
You asked me to suggest media for the advertising campaign. I am going to tell you that the money would be better spent on public relations,green
I don’t want to think that we have a problem here because we don’t. But I want you to put on your green hat and to have a little creative pause with regard to our normal habit of painting cars before we sell them,green
Have a green hat pause on this point: salesmen are paid commission on the sales they make,green
Consider the steering wheel of a car. It does its job well. Pause and green hat it,green
When you are wearing your black thinking hat you do a superb job. I do not want to diminish your critical effectiveness. But what about the green hat,green
Maybe you prefer to be a one hat thinker. Maybe you are not an all- rounder. Maybe you can sing only one tune. Maybe you will have to remain the negative specialist. We shall bring you into the discussion only when we need black hat thinking,green
"At this point we are doing some green hat thinking. If you cannot do that, just keep quiet for the moment",green
You can at least try to use green hat thinking. You will never develop any confidence in it if you do not even try,green
That is a great idea but in its present form it would be much too expensive. Can we shape it so that it is less so,green
At the moment the building regulations would not permit us to do that,green
That is the right product for a large company. But we are small. Is there any way that we can use the idea,green
At the present moment there is interest only in ideas that save money. Is there any way this idea can be seen as saving money – now or later,green
To be acceptable an idea must not be too new. It must be seen to be similar to some old and tried idea that is known to work. What comparisons can we make,green
There is a great emphasis on being able to test ideas in a pilot fashion,green
High tech is the new fashion. Would electronic technology improve this idea,green
My blue hat thinking definitely suggests that we ought to be looking for alternatives at this point,blue
"We do not have much time to consider this matter, so we must use our time effectively. Would someone like to suggest a blue hat structure for our thinking",blue
We have not got anywhere so far. Putting on my blue hat I would suggest we have some red hat thinking to clear the air. What do we actually feel about this proposal to decrease overtime,blue
White hat thinking at this stage,blue
Now we need some proposals. That means yellow hat thinking,blue
Just hold off your black hat thinking for a moment because I am not satisfied with the ideas we have. Let’s have some green hat thinking at this point,blue
"I want to get from each of you your red hat thinking on this. If you remember, when you are wearing the red thinking hat you are allowed to put forward your emotions and feelings without having to justify them in any way at all",blue
You may not know it but you have been using black hat thinking – that is to say negative judgement. You have told us why it will not work. Now I want you to switch for a few moments to yellow hat thinking. This is where you make a positive assessment,blue
I don’t want your opinions or your suggestions. I want a few minutes of pure white hat thinking. The facts and the figures without interpretation,blue
I think we need to pause and to do some blue hat thinking. Forget about the subject for the moment. How should we organize our thinking,blue
We want to focus on preparing a range of possible responses to price cutting by our competitors,blue
Let’s focus on what each of us wants from this holiday,blue
Umbrellas and advertising. I want creative ideas on how ordinary umbrellas could be used for advertising,blue
How can we get satisfied guests to encourage their friends to use our hotel? This is the specific focus,blue
The broad focus is on finding new market segments to use our fast-food outlets. The tight focus is on getting old people to use our facilities at off-peak times,blue
I am putting on my blue hat to say that we have drifted very far from what we set out to think about. We do have a lot of interesting ideas but none of them are relevant to the starting focus. We need to get back on track. Any more blue hat comments,blue
Put on your blue hats and say how you think we are doing. Are we getting anywhere,blue
The question is not so much what we do but when we do it. Timing is vital. What factors should we consider in this timing,blue
The question is whether the tax advantages were really perceived by the client or whether they just provided our salesmen with a convenient selling point for insurance,blue
The cold weather is not really the problem. People’s perception of the cold weather is the problem. That we can change,blue
The problem is not that we have no snow but that we have no skiing. So we take people in buses to where the snow is,blue
Set out the objective of this meeting. What sort of outcome would we regard as successful,blue
Start by listing the areas of agreement between the two parties,blue
The thinking task is to figure out how we might decide this point here and now,blue
List four ‘idea-sensitive areas’ to do with school education,blue
Black hat our current advertising campaign,blue
I just want some exploratory ideas on this business of shopping via TV,blue
How can we find out whether their strategy has been successful,blue
Why are we having difficulty in deciding between these alternatives,blue
We have not come up with an explanation of this increase in the eating of sweets. We shall have to come back to it later and see if we can produce some testable hypotheses,blue
We have not come up with any ideas for increasing the consumption of lamb. Perhaps we had better break it down into sub-problems,blue
We will start with some blue hat thinking to design the program we want to follow,blue
This is an unusual situation. Where do we start? What should we be thinking about,blue
We should start by analysing all the factors that we must take into account in designing this line of children’s clothes,blue
"We should start by mapping out the areas of agreement, the areas of disagreement and the areas of irrelevance in this dispute",blue
In the past what we have done in these situations is as follows,blue
"The traditional approaches are known to you all. Nevertheless, I shall repeat them",blue
I would like to see if there might be any simpler ways of adjusting premium payments to an individual’s cash flow,blue
There has to be a better way of selling books. I want to green hat that,blue
This is what we need to do on this sort of occasion,blue
This is why what you suggest will not work,blue
We are spending too much time arguing about this point. Let us just note it down as a point on which there are conflicting views,blue
"We seem to be much concerned with the cost of this operation, but we have not yet determined if it would provide any benefit. Surely that should come first",blue
"David, you keep pushing this same idea all the time. We do have a note of it as a strong possibility and we will examine it later. I think we should try for some further alternatives. This is meant to be an exploration not an argument",blue
Let’s summarize what we have achieved so far,blue
"I am going to go through the major points that we have discussed. If someone disagrees with my summary, let me know",blue
I suggest we pause here. I suggest we all put on our blue hats and spend the next few minutes individually summarizing what we feel has been achieved so far,blue
Let’s go round the table. Put on your blue hats and tell me where we have got to,blue
Wearing my blue hat it seems to me that our conclusions are as follows,blue
Are we all agreed that these are the conclusions that we reached,blue
I am reaching for my blue thinking hat to say that Ms Brown’s comments are inappropriate at this point,blue
I am going to put on my blue hat in order to say that I think we are straying away from the central issue,blue
"My blue hat thinking tells me that we should define this point as a key problem, then we should attempt to tackle this problem – now or later",blue
"This is red hat thinking. We want your feelings, not why you hold them",blue
"I am sorry, that is clearly black hat thinking and out of order at this point",blue
That is not the way to treat an idea under green hat thinking. You are supposed to use movement not judgement,blue
Is that really supposed to be white hat information? It seems more like red hat feeling,blue
"The blue hat role is to summarize the thinking that has taken place, not to argue in favour of one alternative",blue
I think the increase in turkey meat sales is due to health consciousness,blue
I think it is simply due to the cheaper price,blue
"As we cannot settle this point, we should note down that there are two offered explanations for this trend. We do not have to decide which is the right one",blue
We can now come back to that point we could not decide upon earlier,blue
"Mr Jones thinks that a guarantee on holiday prices will make a big difference to sales. Ms Adams thinks that it will not, and that it could prove very expensive. Let’s spend some time examining this point. What does white hat thinking have to offer? If we had had such a guarantee in past years, what would it have cost us",blue
Under what circumstances would Mr Jones be right? Under what circumstances would Ms Adams be right,blue
"This product would be wonderful for a large company with market dominance. This other product would be suitable for a small company trying to carve out a market niche. Well, which are we",blue
We seem to have got stuck in an argument. We’ll note both points of view and come back to it later,blue
"We are using the map mode and not the argument mode. If you have different points of view, just note them. Don’t try to prove that yours is right and the other one is wrong",blue
You have both had your say. To go any further is arguing and that is not what we are here to do,blue
Will you please stop arguing,blue
I want each of you to do some yellow hat thinking on the other person’s point of view. That should stop the argument,blue
