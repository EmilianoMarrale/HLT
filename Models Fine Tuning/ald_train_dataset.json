This is for autumn wear, so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Sorry, all the tables for three are reserved.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Amazing. The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere!","hat":3},{"utterance":"I'm afraid not.

I'm absolutely flat broke, and I owe my landlady $ 200. she's given me until Friday to give it to her, but I don't get paid until next Monday.

Look, do you know what that emblem means? I've seen it so many times, but I don't know what it stands for.","hat":4},{"utterance":"No, but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once. It actually happened the day after he bought the car!","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes, it wasn't too hard to get. All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Congratulations!

Anyway, I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before. Can \u2019 t people do something to stop it?","hat":0},{"utterance":"All right. By the way, do you often dance?","hat":1},{"utterance":"It might take a long time. Because there is a line, you know.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, with one piece of cloth, and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl","hat":4},{"utterance":"I'd like to do it, of course.

I \u2019 m an adult and I love going to the zoo. I don \u2019 t like animals experiments though. I believe that we can do tests in other ways.","hat":3},{"utterance":"That can easily be arranged. I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them. Anything else?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Brilliant idea! That will make our journey rewarding and much safer. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, I nearly didn't sleep last night.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Mormons believe that, after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10, their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men.

I thought you really enjoyed each other's company.","hat":1},{"utterance":"We are on the high way. Find the pound shade..","hat":3},{"utterance":"That's right. It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway.","hat":2},{"utterance":"All I know about soccer is that you can \u2019 t use your hands and that players are always falling down, trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to me!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Thank you. I wish I would.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Sounds like a pyramid scheme. Have you heard of those before?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Well, it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies.

So, What do you think of going fishing there?","hat":4},{"utterance":"What? Why! I am taking an intercontinental flight! I \u2019 m flying sixteen thousand CMS! How am I supposed to only take two, twenty kilo bags? That \u2019 absurd!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Hey, I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yeah, oh my god! It's still there. We have our first date right on there.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Of course. I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well. They were like family to me.","hat":2},{"utterance":"The job market is so competitive nowadays. I want to develop some useful skills.","hat":4},{"utterance":"isn't there anything else?","hat":2},{"utterance":"yeah, I quit my job, and started working from home.

I can start using the machines.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Let's plan a surprise party for him!","hat":3},{"utterance":"An art! You have a good point there. So it is called martial arts in English. The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Many times there are special services available to certain groups like Women at Work or job help for non-English speakers. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"You got it. Well, he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about, the one from third grade! ","hat":3},{"utterance":"The movie starts at eight o \u2019 clock, so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Of course not. We have cooperated for a long time. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Aw, come on, it was nothing. I'm just doing my job.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Where \u2019 s that? Oh, I know! Madame Tussaud \u2019 s the waxworks museum.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Nothing.

I think I went out at about half pass nine.","hat":2},{"utterance":"You!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Well, I had a terrible day of work, I'm thinking of quiting my job.","hat":0},{"utterance":"May I ask what the name is the girl?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Great. You can help me a lot with English.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely, that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn \u2019 t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it \u2019 s urgent.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Of course. This product moisturizes at the same time.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Excellent. I \u2019 ll see you on Thursday at 9 30.

I'll tell him. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"You always work too hard, Jim. As the saying goes, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

I didn \u2019 t know whom you were with.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Take care of yourself.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I will help to prepare food, feed animals and clean up. I \u2019 m very excited about it now.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I know you are keen on photography. It \u2019 s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera. Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone, anywhere, at a","hat":4},{"utterance":"It is ok. My boss briefs me later on.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Oh, you men! You're all the same. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Are you kidding? I \u2019 m terrible! But I love to watch sports. I go to football or baseball games a lot. And I read sports magazines every week.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes, but you might have told me before.","hat":0},{"utterance":"No, thank you. I had too much to drink yesterday evening. I had a bad hangover this morning. My head felt terrible.","hat":3},{"utterance":"We have too many cars! ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Thanks! We love it.","hat":0},{"utterance":"We're going to put in some new furniture. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"What a pity that the traditional teahouses, as depicted by Lao She, keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis. It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either. Teahouses of today all feature a cozy, comfortable environment, and high-quality services, but can easily cost you a good deal \u2014 just like a coffee bar.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Here's the check. I included a little extra for you.","hat":2},{"utterance":"He's lazy. I tried being a good host, but if you give him an inch, he'll take a mile.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Oh, I understand. I can't say I'm a big fan. I'm from China, and football doesn't have a really big following over there.","hat":2},{"utterance":"The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world!","hat":3},{"utterance":"Just a minute. I am as busy as a bee right now... Ok, I am done. What can I do for you?","hat":4},{"utterance":"I'm afraid not, unless you want a night flight.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That's my cousin Hubert. He likes smiling.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I hear Jean married a business tycoon.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I believe there \u2019 s a sitcom.","hat":1},{"utterance":"And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I mean, what \u2019 s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed in Sichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while though, I got used to the taste, and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I really can't work overtime. Because my husband has been ill recently, I must take care of him.","hat":0},{"utterance":"well, last night I had a big argument with Ann.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!","hat":2},{"utterance":"How nice! I can see you are busying packing. I'm sorry to interrupt you.","hat":3},{"utterance":"That \u2019 s great. We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yes, please.

And it has a small balcony at the top.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I'm going to have my first baby, so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yes, but Americans never visit without calling in advance, and they almost never stay overnight.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I want to take Shield on a date but I don't have much money.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Although I am a little shocked, I can deal with it pretty well. I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview.","hat":0},{"utterance":"What a washing machine! It \u2019 s getting worse today. Look! Now it doesn \u2019 t work at all. I think I need a new one.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I have been working 70 hours this week. I am totally maxed out.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I don't have a warrant.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That's a relief for me and a misery for the children.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Thanks for encouraging me. There are problems cropping up here and there. But I will overcome them one by one.

May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace, and continue in love until life \u2019 s end.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday? ","hat":1},{"utterance":"I'm not very familiar with Chinese cuisine. What can you recommend?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I had a pretty strict up-bring, and my parents and I were always fighting about it.","hat":2},{"utterance":"We could take the subway, but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well. I \u2019 m rather disappointed with it.","hat":0},{"utterance":"All right. I want to bring everybody back on this subject. When can we start working on this?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Ouch! The water's too hot!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Thanks for the advice, Mr. Macmillan. I'll keep it in mind. I had better head off though. I \u2019 m meeting my husband for dinner.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Right. Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then?","hat":3},{"utterance":"That's what I was thinking.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Don't cover up your sadness. Let it go.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Hmm. Well, in that case, we could go to the movies.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I'm afraid it is. So you will have to pay two yuan extra. The total charge is four yuan.","hat":0},{"utterance":"It's time to make our wedding wish come true...","hat":3},{"utterance":"You didn't tell me she was married!","hat":0},{"utterance":"But some women do shake hands. And now a lot of children have such good manners, they shake hands too.","hat":4},{"utterance":"There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Sorry, no. We only take MasterCard or Visa.","hat":0},{"utterance":"It's kind of cool, isn't it? I'm sort of like a secret agent. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Sorry, I don \u2019 t know. I \u2019 m a passengers \u2019 m waiting for my train..","hat":2},{"utterance":"Gee. I must have left it in my hotel room.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Just what? Stop beating around the bush. Tell me what you want to know.","hat":2},{"utterance":"This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"Then he sent you to your home?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Very good idea. Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness.

Is that ok?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Give me a break, Mr Yang.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs. The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items, you can figure out the relative prices of everything else.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Honey, how about taking them to the beach this weekend?","hat":2},{"utterance":"that's good. Have you met Jane yet? She's the intern in the international travel department.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Okay, I'll pick you up at eight o'clock. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"He makes me nervous.

That \u2019 s all junk food!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Not bad.How about you? Haven't seen you for a long time.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems. They are always too busy to help a green hand like me.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Because I'm the wrong sex, of course!","hat":0},{"utterance":"When I quarrel with my husband. He didn't even try to cool me out.","hat":0},{"utterance":"They weren \u2019 t supposed to arrest me.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Here's your schedule.

It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world. People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That \u2019 s understandable. Every kid likes new clothes.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution, and partly because of our new marketing strategy. Because of the new advertising campaign, we have become the top sellers in the field.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I know! She could sell fridges to Eskimos!","hat":3},{"utterance":"Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore?","hat":4},{"utterance":"It's fine with me. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Fruit juice, cake and refreshments and everything.","hat":4},{"utterance":"The skateboard does not pollute the air, either. It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues.

More than that, you have Italy pizza, English steak, kimchi and local specialties.","hat":4},{"utterance":"No way. I've given you too many chances already. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great. It is really great. I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least. Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I can \u2019 t bear to look at it.

Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, don \u2019 t you?

I was out exploring the city Monday night.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities, such as answering routine correspondence, taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Anytime. You can reach me at 5558929.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Believe it or not, tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Come on!

Does he have your number, Mr. Smith?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Sorry, sir. We have only tables in the main dinning room left.

I can't wait for the weekend!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Let \u2019 s go then. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"Well, Superbad is super funny.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yes. It says it will be sunny all day. No sign of rain at all.","hat":3},{"utterance":"At 8 o'clock. I will make the reservation.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Well, we could eat in more. That $ 300 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants.","hat":4},{"utterance":"So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street! ","hat":4},{"utterance":"Hi, Tony. Haven \u2019 t seen you for a long time. How have you been?","hat":1},{"utterance":"You will be very beautiful on your wedding day.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Don \u2019 t dress like that. You \u2019 ll make fool yourself. You look stupid in that robe.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Oh, you don \u2019 t have to do that but it would be a great help.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Sometimes people in different countries, or even in different parts of the same country have varying outlooks because of the tribe and culture. ","hat":2},{"utterance":"How many chances have I given you, I've given up on you.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing! That's just the problem. In these kind of things, the trouble doesn't always appear at first.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Welcome to our company Mr white. My name is Yan Hua, the secretary of Mr Wang.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Maybe you're right. I have been too lazy lately. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"The counselors were so nice too. It was the best summer ever. Except for all those mosquitoes! ","hat":1},{"utterance":"That's absolutely ridiculous! ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Thanks your flatter. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary.","hat":0},{"utterance":"It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Last weekend, while they were on the Sik trip.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Are you kidding? When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I agree completely. I just don't understand what's wrong with them. Don't they have any humanity?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Yes, I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Yes, I do feel the same way about France. The swift rivers, the fertile valleys, the large cities-its scenery is beautiful. Will you describe the geography of Japan?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Hey, Mary, what's up?","hat":1},{"utterance":"there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yeah, good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill. I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Sounds like a good idea. And I think this can leave deep impression to HR. How can we write a suitable letter?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Get better.","hat":3},{"utterance":"We have all kinds of movie channel packages.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Ok, under this contract, we \u2019 ll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts, S, M and L equally assorted, at USD 100 per dozen, CFR London.

I see a twinkle in your eyes.","hat":3},{"utterance":"That \u2019 s one reason I \u2019 d like to try it. I \u2019 d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office.","hat":4},{"utterance":"All right, I see. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"I hate computer games.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You \u2019 re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.","hat":0},{"utterance":"How about ten o'clock tomorrow?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Sure, we wouldn't miss that for anything. After that, we took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour.","hat":3},{"utterance":"My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office.

I have to give you a ticket.","hat":0},{"utterance":"So did you get in touch with your brother?","hat":2},{"utterance":"So you \u2019 d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing.

Good-bye.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Hey, Benjamin, have you finished your report on the project?","hat":1},{"utterance":"The people don \u2019 t really work out there. They just stand around and talk all the time.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Oh, my God! I feel nothing is going smooth.","hat":0},{"utterance":"We got lost coming back. I guess I don't really know this town yet.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Then how about a salesman?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Who cares! Well, the smart guys get there early. That's the kind of guy I want to meet. Let's go!","hat":4},{"utterance":"What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, but staring.He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Wow! What a beautiful scenic spot! It's so open. And just breathe that fresh air, you can almost taste its freshness.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Some people get nasty on those comments.

But I know we'll never agree on this subject. You prefer the car. I prefer the train.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well, it's a special day. They say if you survive the first year, the rest is smooth sailing.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I \u2019 m sorry, sir. Could you tell me your name and order again, please? I \u2019 ll check on the delay.","hat":0},{"utterance":"No sweat! Think nothing of it. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"As you know, our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia.

Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I have taken some courses in college, such as translation, business English, and so on. So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English","hat":2},{"utterance":"I'd like to, but the photocopier is out of order.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I tell ya, when I got the invite, it really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Make it three cups. Here comes Harry. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"That's rock and roll with fast tempo.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I know. This is terrible. What can we do? This snow doesn't stop falling!","hat":0},{"utterance":"My son has really taken it out of me.

And I will be waiting for you right here, praying for you and our baby.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Good-bye, sir ","hat":3},{"utterance":"That is a heavy raining afternoon.

You're engaged! What a beautiful engagement ring! Who to?","hat":3},{"utterance":"If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Although the weather here is very cold, the people are warm.","hat":1},{"utterance":"After watching my diet, what else should I do?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Right. The faint of heart should not apply.","hat":1},{"utterance":"No, rice isn't grown in France. But farming, fishing and industry are also very important in France. I'd like to go to Japan some day. Would you like to visit France?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate. I'm really fed up with all this.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Of course you can. Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less, but don't chat over the phone. What's more, don't let it hinder your work and the company's business.","hat":2},{"utterance":"What would you like to see in Beijing?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well, not in so many words. But I know that productivity is a big issue for him. Oh, he said the usual things like \u201c Keep up the good work \u201d and \u201c Thanks for your hard work, \u201d but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department. That, to me, means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Is a family like yours common in South Korea?","hat":2},{"utterance":"How nice of him! I'll be delighted to go. But what time would be convenient?","hat":1},{"utterance":"It was a round day for me. My family attend the graduation ceremony. I was so nervous. I couldn't find my cap and gown, but all worked out in the end.","hat":3},{"utterance":"What date is today?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well, I seem to be a little bit lost here. I am worried that I \u2019 ll never find my way. What's worse. I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, that's right. I like this city very much and would like to make my home here.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Well, if that's the case, I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have. I can only do what I know, and live how I've lived all my life, because I'm a fairly stubborn person.","hat":2},{"utterance":"And they lack originality. Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol '.","hat":4},{"utterance":"OK. Let me have a try...","hat":4},{"utterance":"No. It's no problem.Are you American?","hat":1},{"utterance":"I can't. I am really behind of my work.

Wow Betty, thank you so much! I really appreciate it!","hat":3},{"utterance":"Well yes, but they are not allowed only in downtown areas. It's OK here. It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition. The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken. Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Let's go and try now! ","hat":3},{"utterance":"well, I work in the marketing department. The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer. Before, when I was assigned a task, I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don","hat":2},{"utterance":"I mean you can buy things through the Internet, that is E-commerce.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I know. Stay with me. She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss. First, though, she had to discover her true cat nature. At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone, who was the real danger in the company. She had actually murdered the boss, who was her husband, and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder, so everyone thought Batwoman was evil.","hat":4},{"utterance":"It is. However, you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider.","hat":3},{"utterance":"For the bank manager?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well, after the half of the meeting, there will be an interval for rest and refreshment. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yeah, and we can get to know each other at the party. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"My bad. I didn't realize that it was so late.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Yes, sometimes the differences are great.","hat":2},{"utterance":"let \u2019 s think. He loves football, doesn \u2019 t he? I saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear. Let \u2019 s go and have a look. You know which team he supports, don \u2019 t you?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well I always hear it on the radio, so I started to get into it.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Come on mom. I'm your A! Wait till the guys hear about this!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Oh, honey. You came. I'm so glad! Why are you wearing a bonnet?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yeah, I'll call later to patch things up.

Is it available?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Did you see the information on sales for last year? The sales review was made at our last board meeting. There's a great news for our shareholders.","hat":2},{"utterance":"My pleasure. ( It was my pleasure. ) ","hat":3},{"utterance":"It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this. Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you. All you have to do it get on the train tonight a","hat":2},{"utterance":"It's a pleasure. Come on. I'm on your side. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"I think it's a great idea. Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities. Are you planning on going abroad?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well, in the fifties, that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint.","hat":4},{"utterance":"How about the Korean restaurant next to it?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes. We have all kinds of colors for it.","hat":4},{"utterance":"These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line. If they're charging 10 % less than we are, we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I think he has realized that. But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Oh, flowers! What for, my dear?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Devi, do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday?","hat":1},{"utterance":"All right. May I have your name?","hat":1},{"utterance":"It was horrible! I played play it much better at home!","hat":0},{"utterance":"What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Try a Stinger. It has lime juice and grenadine over ice.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Soup does the body good, sweetie. It's what you need when you're under the weather. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it, while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period. Look carefully, and tell me if you see the difference now.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes, he is. He \u2019 s very hardworking when he \u2019 s at school. Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner. After dinner, he goes out with his friends.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Thanks, but I speak English with a strong German accent.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I will. Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap? I mean this is the last day.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Great idea! I do it every so often.","hat":3},{"utterance":"You dare to doubt me?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Well, I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car!","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs. I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes. That way you can play games online without any lag. This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free!","hat":4},{"utterance":"Now that's an exciting job!!!","hat":3},{"utterance":"I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave. He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet.","hat":0},{"utterance":"We could always wait for the next bus to come.

I don't want my friends to know I failed!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom. He is putting on grand airs.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Oh, he's really reserved, normally. But, from what I hear, he's got lots of problems.","hat":2},{"utterance":"The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south, mild in the central part and cold in the north. Except for Hokkaido, we don't get much snowfall at all. France has a mild climate, doesn't it?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Hi, Ann. I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night?","hat":1},{"utterance":"The blue SUV in front of the Honda.","hat":1},{"utterance":"It's my health-conscious lunch, good for my health and beauty.","hat":3},{"utterance":"do you like working in teams?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Oh, that hurts.","hat":0},{"utterance":"The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel. There \u2019 s a special one just for kids.","hat":3},{"utterance":"It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case, would it? Let's still use cartons.","hat":1},{"utterance":"No! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago. Now my engine is on fire!","hat":0},{"utterance":"All right. Let me prepare the supper. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"You look a little lost, can I help you?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Oh, yes, indeed. I've run out of steam.

I've got loads of songs on my new iPod.","hat":1},{"utterance":"if you study hard, I don't see why you wouldn't. Have you received any other offers?","hat":4},{"utterance":"I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Sorry, it \u2019 s all sold out.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Actually, I don't think so. Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace. They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees. If there is no one to keep an eye on us, no one would get any work done. You know what they say, when the cat's away, the mice play.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I am afraid not. Have you lost your passport?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Fine! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon! ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Me too. That movie brought tears to my eyes.","hat":3},{"utterance":"How should I know? It's just kind of cold in the middle. It just doesn't taste right. Do you want to try it?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Right. But people at that time only know two words, \" save \" and \" assistance \", they will never don't lift a finger. Life is the most important compared with anything else.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Well, the style is quite good, but I think it's too showy. I would like to try on the lighter one. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"I wasn't aware that I had to go to court.","hat":0},{"utterance":"You know, it's OK for a girl to forget these \" big days \", but for a guy, to do that is unforgivable.","hat":0},{"utterance":"You mean... like on a second date?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Mike, what are you doing tonight?","hat":1},{"utterance":"I surely am. But still there is one single problem.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Thank you. I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing!","hat":3},{"utterance":"This is designed to exclude them from domestic market, isn't it?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?","hat":1},{"utterance":"The most important is that it is very convenient.

I'd like to go there next time.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Your best isn't good enough.

We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, you're welcome to join us.","hat":3},{"utterance":"It's going to be sunny tomorrow. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"Home run by Okapi! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium!

","hat":1},{"utterance":"Maybe you got your plate too full this semester? You can change that next semester.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Maybe 500 dollars.","hat":1},{"utterance":"There \u2019 s no way that I can stay here.","hat":0},{"utterance":"How long did it take you to get your driver's license?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Good harbors! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world, and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world. Also, there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands. France isn't very mountainous, is it?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I'm so sorry about your brother, Mr. Wang.","hat":0},{"utterance":"What happens if I am not satisfied with my purchases?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, I think I am quite fluent in English. I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I was, but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, so I \u2019 m not a member now.","hat":2},{"utterance":"So, what did you get them?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yup, that \u2019 s him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.","hat":0},{"utterance":"And you think about her all the time?","hat":3},{"utterance":"But you should have told me you were in love with her.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Mike, you're late again.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question?","hat":2},{"utterance":"oh, it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs. When did you get started?","hat":2},{"utterance":"That \u2019 s very good. I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful.","hat":2},{"utterance":"You know you didn't.","hat":0},{"utterance":"If you have any questions. I will help you.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well, I suppose one of the problems is... will depend on what a person's life style is, and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television, he will then, you know, hmm. be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things.","hat":2},{"utterance":"It's excellent.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yeah, or the expensive Italian facial treatments. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"What if there's something wrong with it?","hat":4},{"utterance":"I \u2019 Ve thought about that a lot. I know that many women take a job, planning to make a career of it, and then they change their mind. But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work. So if I get married, I will find some ways that I can continue my work.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I love anything with chocolate the best.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Now, David, can I get you a drink? What will you have?","hat":1},{"utterance":"How about that one?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Right, thanks.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well. As our sole agency, you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I see. What else?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Peter, why don't you go outside and play basketball with your friends?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Get out of here!","hat":0},{"utterance":"It is real word.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Hey, Tom, I want to learn how to play golf.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I think the government fined him a small amount, and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He \u2019 s still a millionaire.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Yes, thank you. I am really far behind on this project. Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Sorry, sir. We receive credit card and cash only.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Graham, why are you always on the phone with Jane?","hat":2},{"utterance":"As a matter of fact, I would like to work in South America. So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"Great! I'm your lucky fellow then. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"By all means.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Sure. It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events. Have you ever been to the live show?","hat":2},{"utterance":"They have lollypops, chocolate drops, fruit candy, mints, pearbrittles and toffee. They are in different colors and flavors.","hat":3},{"utterance":"The library is next to the Adminstration Building. The Adminstration Building is over there near the school \u2019 s main entrance. There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin.","hat":4},{"utterance":"You are attracted to her. That sounds great, but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love?","hat":2},{"utterance":"OK, Let me see. I suppose we must strengthen our promotion, because our brand is still new to some consumers. Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously, because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places. Besides, the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Don't worry. I'll make you another on the house. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"Very interesting. But I'm afraid we'd better do something else. Hey, look! There is a huge lantern there. Let's get close to it.","hat":3},{"utterance":"He's fine. He retired last week. It's a turning point in his life. Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement.","hat":2},{"utterance":"what a pity that the traditional teahouses, as depicted Lao She, keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis. It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend","hat":4},{"utterance":"But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I think that's a bad idea. I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend. How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want?","hat":0},{"utterance":"It's awfully quiet around here.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I just got fired.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Are you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I'm sorry. What's your name again?","hat":3},{"utterance":"We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore and Tokyo, we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Let's get a soft drink.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Sure. The first food you have is appetizer, followed by a soup. Then you will have the main course. The last dishes are desserts.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Peter, listen to the lyrics of this song.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Then I'll shoot some pictures, re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog.","hat":3},{"utterance":"But yesterday you said you would rent it.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yes, I agree. We can see the scenery better. In a bus, all you see are the roads.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I \u2019 m sorry sir. This computer is not broken or damaged. It \u2019 s simply just too old! That \u2019 s why your programs and applications are running slow. There really isn \u2019 t much I can do.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Alright. Bye. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"That sounds fine. What time shall we meet at the bus stop?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I saw an interesting program on TV last night. It was about elderly people.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.","hat":2},{"utterance":"OK. You can change it.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Sounds good. But on Saturday there's a football final.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Oh, yes. I heard there was an opera fans club. They are probably practicing now. Wanna have a look?","hat":2},{"utterance":"part of the motor is loose. I can put it back in place quite easily.","hat":4},{"utterance":"How's the weather today?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yeah, I \u2019 m better after talking to you.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That's smart. I'm going to start doing the same thing. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Did you take any pictures?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Thank you. Well, if you ever pass my home, please drop in.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I'd like to. But I'm not myself today.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Oh! I hit it.","hat":3},{"utterance":"When did it become CABS?","hat":1},{"utterance":"really well, thanks.","hat":1},{"utterance":"wonderful! I think that's a great idea. How soon until we can make this happen? I can't wait!","hat":1},{"utterance":"I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office.

","hat":3},{"utterance":"Great. Well, the main issue here, as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof.","hat":2},{"utterance":"You see, I've been offered a new job. I can't decide whether to take it or not.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I know, Blake. But you \u2019 Ve been avoiding me all morning, and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I don \u2019 t think they are right. I have tried my best and that's enough. It is unfair that they are always saying these thing. Sometimes I even feel deeply hurt. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"I don't want to.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I see myself as being honest, diligent, persevering and creative. And I have a strong sense of responsibility.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well, no. I thought I \u2018 Ve finish in five minutes. and I didn \u2019 t want to be difficult about just few minutes, if I hadn \u2019 t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn \u2019 t have been so late. I \u2019 m sorry.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Shut up. You should think how to make fortunes, not look for a squabble. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"yes, look over there. That's the Empire State Building. My book says it's 102 stories tall.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Oh, but I can't. It wasn't my fault.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Let's meet half way, 20 yuan, OK?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Jason, it's your turn.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well. It's not all my fault, Anna. You are responsible, too.","hat":1},{"utterance":"So, now we have covered all the important points.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Mr.Martin, we're on arrival.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Aw, come on; it was nothing. I'm just doing my job.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Why not go and see a doctor?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Hmm. I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision. I'm sorry.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Thank you. Where is your key?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Good, I can see the library on the map.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Let's just look and see what they have.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well, step two is grinding the coffee beans. I've roasted three different types of beans.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I've got a complaint about the noise next door.","hat":2},{"utterance":"But why were you getting off work so late? The office close at six, doesn't it?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Yeah.Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Because it hasn't been copyrighted. We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright, we are investigating companies to produce the products.","hat":2},{"utterance":"How do you know that I didn \u2019 t try? I just couldn \u2019 t manage it. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes? They look nice. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"A well-learned person never does that. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"You're going to have to tell them what to do in church, what everything means...","hat":4},{"utterance":"How annoying!","hat":0},{"utterance":"I like people who are open and friendly. Those people are usually more active and fun to be with. I like spending time with my friends. We go to bars together or play sports together.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Oh, to be frank, I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Nobody knows at the moment, but it has been very hot there recently. The drought in Africa is causing starvation. Millions of people have migrated to try and find food.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master \u2019 s in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Open this card and read.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yes, I knew I could do that. Exactly how do I go about selling them?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Has your family lived here for long?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I think that, as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure, it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people, and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced.","hat":2},{"utterance":"And so I bought all these books on having kids and...","hat":3},{"utterance":"I \u2019 m sorry to hear about that. Why don \u2019 t you join me for a hot cup of tea? It \u2019 ll be good for you!","hat":2},{"utterance":"I'm sorry. I've lost my tags and receipt. How can I do about it?","hat":0},{"utterance":"I would like you to meet my family. Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Let's take a cab. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"All right. Let me get you something to drink. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"But I won't let you do that. I will watch you.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Oh, my God! It's good we have food.","hat":3},{"utterance":"All these products are our best-selling lines. The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand. And we are always open to negotiate, especially on larger orders. What do you have in mind?","hat":2},{"utterance":"you are dressed to kill. You look gorgeous, Alexander.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Bob, I'm really upset with you.","hat":0},{"utterance":"You were there when the problem started. I was hoping you could fill me in on the details.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I can't take the credit for that. I'm just Zina's assistant. She's the pro. ","hat":2},{"utterance":"I'm glad.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That's terrible.","hat":0},{"utterance":"This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze! If it does, we \u2019 ll give you your money back! ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Do many people like tennis?","hat":1},{"utterance":"It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yeah, I went over the figures this morning. We're finally started making money again!","hat":2},{"utterance":"I have some good news for you.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I think dimes and quarters will do. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"What's more, it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I agree. I like his brother, Paul. They are not alike.","hat":1},{"utterance":"But Mom! Today we \u2019 re playing football! I love football!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Thank you, yes. I'm not sure how to use this ATM, I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book. But today, I thought I'd try something new. I want to take some money out.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well, I studied French at school, but I \u2019 Ve forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa","hat":2},{"utterance":"I am fed up with Jack. He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Scraping is too terrifying. When they finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured. Cupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over. It looks like someone beat you up.","hat":0},{"utterance":"We have absolute proof that you committed the crime.","hat":1},{"utterance":"He's a hero in our town.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Really? What do the companies do that for?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I'm really happy that you came to visit me.","hat":1},{"utterance":"John made out with other girls at the party yesterday. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yes. There are several data documents about this contract. Please advise me which one I should give up.","hat":2},{"utterance":"sure, that would be great.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Aw come on! It \u2019 s just some innocent fun! You know how these things are! We are gonna play drinking games, get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.","hat":2},{"utterance":"If you ask me, I have to disagree. Something shouldn't be watched for fun. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock, will it do?","hat":3},{"utterance":"But work is a huge portion of our lives. I'm looking forward to making it fun.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I have a tuition scholarship from the university. Otherwise I \u2019 m on my own.","hat":4},{"utterance":"It's a wise thing to do. Art will do a child a world of good. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"I'm sorry, but this was on sale, so I can only give you store credit.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Guess what! I know something you don't know!","hat":3},{"utterance":"I am not sure about the name of the film, but I know it's a romantic one.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes. He \u2019 s so energetic. We take him out to the park every morning and evening. I think he \u2019 d be happy to stay there all day!","hat":4},{"utterance":"What kind of personal information?","hat":1},{"utterance":"So when did this happen?","hat":2},{"utterance":"nothing else has happened to me, but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close.","hat":2},{"utterance":"A laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment, keep a check on the supplies in the store, and prepare the chemicals for experiments.","hat":2},{"utterance":"You've got so many cousins. I called you later that night. But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone.","hat":0},{"utterance":"So what would your role in the company?","hat":1},{"utterance":"I don't know. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"What could be worse than what you just told me?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Look, Danny. The Four Great Inventions!","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yeah, I have the same feeling. Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality. Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed. But at a wholesale market, you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Actually, I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan! My classes are great, though. Sociology is the perfect major for me. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, madam. May I help you?","hat":1},{"utterance":"No, I \u2019 d rather go out. The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home. Maybe we can try some other food today... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day, the one over in the shopping center?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Of course not. I knew she had fallen in love with another guy. It is difficult to see her move on so quickly.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Of course, I will.Well, it's time for me to say goodbye.The plane will take off soon.Hope some day you will come to America for a visit.","hat":2},{"utterance":"But it is really worthwhile.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Too bad. But, is there any other leather store nearby?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Far more than that, I dare to say! Inland provinces and cities, Hong Kong and Macao, as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants. Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region, and folk performances are given. You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"I suppose so. I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process. Certainly without my colleagues ' help, I could not do these things in such a short period.","hat":2},{"utterance":"sure, it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds. Good luck! ","hat":3},{"utterance":"Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I want justice. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"We are ready to help you.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Excuse me. Could you please take a picture of us with this camera?","hat":1},{"utterance":"We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi! There \u2019 s the pitch, he hits it! It \u2019 s going, going, that ball is gone!","hat":3},{"utterance":"He's a very creative painter. His paintings sell well.","hat":3},{"utterance":"He must be very easy-going.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I wouldn \u2019 t exactly characterize it in that way. I think something happened. Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to... what if he showed up, took one look at me and left?","hat":0},{"utterance":"English and computer skills are comparatively important to this position, especially in the starting period. What \u2019 s your ability in these two fields?","hat":1},{"utterance":"I love that dish as well. It is coconut chicken with rice.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Are you working fewer hours than you used to work?","hat":2},{"utterance":"What do you do in winter?","hat":1},{"utterance":"what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Have you ever been to America?","hat":2},{"utterance":"No, they live alone. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Trust you! You can't even handle simple plane reservations!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Yes, I know, sir. I'm sorry.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Yes, the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes, they do. Do you have a Christmas tree this year?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Then why did you leave?","hat":1},{"utterance":"But wait, wait, will there be food that is not meat? You know. I'm a vegetarian","hat":4},{"utterance":"You speak really well.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Thank you so much. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Ur, it stinks!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Congratulations! What's your normal handicap?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Really? I \u2019 m not sure that I would like all the attention. There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star \u2019 s private live in recent years.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes, trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Alright. See ya!","hat":1},{"utterance":"Look behind us at the mountains! They're reflecting pink!","hat":3},{"utterance":"B:: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Well, you are over at the law school. So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms. Connors. We \u2019 re supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Well, I was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all. Take a look at this! ","hat":4},{"utterance":"You are pretending!","hat":1},{"utterance":"I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said \u201c American way. \u201d It \u2019 s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way?","hat":4},{"utterance":"No problem. Did you bring any gifts back for your department?","hat":1},{"utterance":"I understand that, but you'd feel better if you took a break, even for just a short while. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Oh, it is coming to us, come on, Ben, get a banana to it.","hat":4},{"utterance":"That's what everyone says! I can't wait to see it for myself some day. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"well, I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yes, please. Thank you for everything. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Very much.New York is such a nice place.Shall I show you some photographs?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Oh, OK.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yeah, it is a good idea. You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to.","hat":4},{"utterance":"You are so lucky! Send me a postcard! ","hat":3},{"utterance":"You are doing the waltz wonderfully well.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I'd like her to have a change.","hat":4},{"utterance":"if you can choose, will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese?","hat":1},{"utterance":"I like Business Management, and i think it's very useful for the present work.","hat":1},{"utterance":"What's the difference?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Do you have any idea what time it is?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Sorry, you can only pay cash.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That \u2019 s all right. Let me see, oh, that lace looks so unique, and it \u2019 s so creative to make a picture display here. How did you get that idea?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Ah I see, yes you do sound rather croaky. Well let \u2019 s have a look, shall we? Could you please open your mouth and say \u201d ah \u201d.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Go ahead. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Well. I can't find my key now. I think I have lost it.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That depends. Some semesters have many, some don't. And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers. That's easy.","hat":4},{"utterance":"great. Sweet wines are my favorite. They always make a great finish to a decisions meal.","hat":3},{"utterance":"It sounds so moving. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"Oh, so he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, then?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Very well. If I leave I'll miss you.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I'm so happy. I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore.","hat":3},{"utterance":"I can show it to you now, if you like. I think it goes back about 8 generations so far.","hat":2},{"utterance":"yes, now that you mention it, I think we had a chemistry class together in high school.","hat":2},{"utterance":"How about interviews? Have you been on any of those yet?","hat":2},{"utterance":"I'm afraid not, sir. I've made up my mind. It's something I have to do.","hat":0},{"utterance":"You are very nice to tell me those.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Got it. Thanks for reminding me. And, are there any intensive training courses? ","hat":4},{"utterance":"The snow is so beautiful. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected.

I miss you very much.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see I \u2019 Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My Father was in the oil business","hat":2},{"utterance":"you're kidding me! that sounds really scary!","hat":1},{"utterance":"Sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, it \u2019 s easy to figure out.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Welcome to our department. I hope you'll like it here.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I've no idea. I'd like to listen to your suggestion.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well we have espresso, cappuccino, latte, skinny latte or Americano.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands. Disgraceful!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Why don \u2019 t you marry Rose, then? ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Which is more interesting to you, flying kites or going roller-skating?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Well, you know how important a clean house is to your grandma.","hat":4},{"utterance":"It \u2019 s the worst thing I \u2019 Ve ever tried. ","hat":0},{"utterance":"Says who? I don't think that is necessarily the case.","hat":0},{"utterance":"This place is so quiet and peaceful. It \u2019 s really different from my pad at city.","hat":2},{"utterance":"But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people. So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate.","hat":2},{"utterance":"He is such a handsome guy. He gets his looks from his mother of course!","hat":2},{"utterance":"Good. I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror!","hat":1},{"utterance":"He appeals to the fans thanks to two things","hat":1},{"utterance":"We can get both at the cafeteria. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"We surely believe you.","hat":1},{"utterance":"You look great.Your make-up is perfect.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Nice to see you too.It ' s been a long time.","hat":3},{"utterance":"What do you think might be the source of its popularity?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Couldn \u2019 t be better. And you?","hat":1},{"utterance":"That's OK with me. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Since last time we've climbed the mountain, we haven't gone out for a long time.","hat":2},{"utterance":"No I am free, I will be there, what time the thing starting?","hat":3},{"utterance":"I go to the fitness center every weekend.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Sure, I advise the sightseeing buses.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, I am. I enjoyed studying it at school, though I had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks.","hat":2},{"utterance":"It is hard to guess now. Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time. I guess the game will end in a tie. They are equally matched.","hat":2},{"utterance":"It sure is. The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece. No man could ever make anything like this.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Then you must be interested in disco dancing, aren't you?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness, instead of taking their rights away from speaking.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Oh, your precious game. You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals!","hat":0},{"utterance":"It \u2019 s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That \u2019 s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, so shiny! I am going to work my magic on your hair! You hear me? You are going to look like a million bucks!","hat":3},{"utterance":"a separated office, internet access, phone services, fax services, mail & courier services, and almost everything you have in a conventional office.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Why not go to see the doctor?","hat":2},{"utterance":"It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars.","hat":4},{"utterance":"When I have a specific project to complete, I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end. I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines. I expect some deviation from the original plan, but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far. I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I can think of five houses that we should look at. It will take most of the day.","hat":4},{"utterance":"That works for me! ","hat":0},{"utterance":"What about this one? It sells like hot cakes.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Oh, that's a nice one of all of you together. Do you have the negative? May I have a copy?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Well, that's a bit stiff. Do you have some cheaper ones?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Really? Why we must have warm and fresh water?","hat":4},{"utterance":"It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind '.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes. He \u2019 s already got the passport and visa.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Oh, I'm so sorry. May I ask what you ordered again?","hat":0},{"utterance":"Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I don't feel like going out tonight, I am way too tired. I miss you, sweetheart.","hat":1},{"utterance":"That \u2019 s great, because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves. I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"No. I like to be outside. I took up hiking and mountain biking. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"He \u2019 s going to be sent to Britain to study, really?","hat":3},{"utterance":"I see. What are the options? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail.","hat":4},{"utterance":"One more thing, keep your desk neat. It's the rule. There is no exception, even the art designers have to keep their desks neat.","hat":2},{"utterance":"At least I enjoy my lunch! What's in your bag?","hat":0},{"utterance":"I want take shell on a date, but I don \u2019 t have much money.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I am sorry for making you wait so long. Now there is a table available in non-smoking section. Please follow me.","hat":0},{"utterance":"If you detect any difference, I'll take you out to dinner.","hat":4},{"utterance":"I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way. Can we leave this dull place now?","hat":3},{"utterance":"yes, we can, but it isn \u2019 t very interesting.","hat":4},{"utterance":"He just stays in the kitchen and watches you. Before the Chinese New Year, the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year. Just like Lester does!","hat":0},{"utterance":"But I lost the chance.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I don't care what the best part is. Whatever you say won't change my mind. I'm not buying anything!","hat":1},{"utterance":"That's great. You can go take a look. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"The London Weekly right?","hat":1},{"utterance":"I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Yeah, but come on, Geoff, as if you don \u2019 t check Facebook at work. Look, you hired this guy, we \u2019 Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training, so now it \u2019 s up to you to coach him. Make it work, Geoff!","hat":1},{"utterance":"On top fo all of that, she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space. she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That's horrible. Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work?","hat":0},{"utterance":"I like it a lot. It has a very funny beginning, I think. It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I turned on my laptop and it broke! I mean, the monitor went black!","hat":0},{"utterance":"Have you ever served in any international trading company?","hat":2},{"utterance":"We have a three-shift system - that's three eight-hour shifts each weekday. We're shut at weekends. This week I'm on the early shift.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I \u2019 m sure they are. Oh, and a local man won the lottery. I \u2019 m so jealous! I wish it were me! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I \u2019 m amazed that I haven \u2019 t even won a small prize yet. It \u2019 s so unfair!","hat":0},{"utterance":"I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, emergency. There is a huge fire here.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I had a pretty strict upbringing, and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Yes, I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor, salesman, and model.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I think I will continue my studies. Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree. We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Perhaps you should exercise more. Why don't you go to an exercise class?","hat":4},{"utterance":"( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve! Time to open presents!","hat":3},{"utterance":"The five dolls are sold together as a set, and they're priced according to the size.

","hat":3},{"utterance":"What a splendid idea!","hat":4},{"utterance":"I'm sorry, but I can't! That's something my grandmother would sing! ","hat":0},{"utterance":"But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants..","hat":4},{"utterance":"It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Oh! You mean she doesn \u2019 t have to work now? It \u2019 s hard for young parents not to overreact, isn \u2019 t it? ","hat":2},{"utterance":"It's called love is blind, I think. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"That's cool. What documents do I need to carry?","hat":3},{"utterance":"I still like the olive one best. There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I hear that you've got a chance to go to Europe for a half-year training program.

Not everyone likes public transport.","hat":2},{"utterance":"So you'll have a tour of the famous city.","hat":1},{"utterance":"I haven't thought of that. ","hat":4},{"utterance":"Better than ever! You won \u2019 t have to worry about \u201c finding \u201d extra money for me anymore! We made nearly a quarter of million in profit last year!","hat":3},{"utterance":"It's been a long time, hasn't it? How have you been?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Thank you. I'll go through it and tell you.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Buy more and get more special discount coupons.","hat":4},{"utterance":"What are your plans for the future if you are hired?","hat":1},{"utterance":"How can we do that?","hat":3},{"utterance":"What are you and Corey doing for Valentine \u2019 s Day this Friday?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones.

Our supplier has gone bust. The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice. We also need to arrange transport to the factory.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven \u2019 t bought my mom anything! I \u2019 m such a bad son!","hat":0},{"utterance":"His son is coming as well. He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Oh, I forgot to tell you this. The show is to collect money for children in need. And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross.","hat":2},{"utterance":"It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that.","hat":2},{"utterance":"I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night. But I still haven't got it. I am so hungry now.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Okay, I'll have everything prepared for you when you get here.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Yes, I have a three-year-old son. ","hat":1},{"utterance":"If I won the Pools, I'd go round the world.","hat":1},{"utterance":"That's a cool idea.

Maybe another time.","hat":1},{"utterance":"It is really a hard nut to crack. The problem is that the crime was done without leaving any trace. ","hat":2},{"utterance":"He must be very brave.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Do you think you will want to continue working here even after you \u2019 Ve had a child?","hat":1},{"utterance":"What a pity. I believe it's a very good film.","hat":1},{"utterance":"This cake is excellent. Where did you buy it?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Great. Let's go. ","hat":3},{"utterance":"I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job.","hat":1},{"utterance":"That's great. We can go to the bank together.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft. Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Congratulations! ","hat":1},{"utterance":"Then when do you think we could go out together?","hat":1},{"utterance":"Matthew? Hi!","hat":1},{"utterance":"I am not good at it by any means.

Are you bored?","hat":0},{"utterance":"How have you been getting on with your studies so far?","hat":2},{"utterance":"Well, the wrong information is in my file.

Thank you for asking, Joe.","hat":1},{"utterance":"Good morning, Emma! A lovely day, isn't it?","hat":3},{"utterance":"Here is the thing. I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night. Even I unplugged it, it wouldn't stop beeping. I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room.

I think I need more practice.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Right. You can \u2019 t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs.","hat":2},{"utterance":"The operation was very successful.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Oh. no. The motor coach is air-conditioned, there is a galley for food preparation, movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need.","hat":2},{"utterance":"OK, Allen. It's your turn. Are you ready?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Yes, yes, I am sorry I won't keep you. It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time.

I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. I also have a revolver that \u2019 s really fun too! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you","hat":3},{"utterance":"Do you like swimming?","hat":1},{"utterance":"OK, but don't believe everything you see on The X-files, either!","hat":1},{"utterance":"I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I \u2019 m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.","hat":2},{"utterance":"That's great. Let's go! ","hat":3},{"utterance":"I wish my parents were a little more lenient.","hat":0},{"utterance":"Oh, without a doubt. When is the next class?","hat":1},{"utterance":"My opponent bowled me with the very first ball. I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis.","hat":0},{"utterance":"That is an excellent choice, and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner.","hat":4},{"utterance":"Let's just get both. Do you bring enough money?","hat":4},{"utterance":"I \u2019 m glad they \u2019 re coming in August. Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game.","hat":3},{"utterance":"Exactly, I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning, they were from the company on the 12th floor, I guess. They were only three of us in the elevator, I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them.","hat":2},{"utterance":"Why don \u2019 t you have a water or juice instead, so you don \u2019 t get dehydrated?","hat":4},{"utterance":"Gosh, another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes, It's no quicker than a bus.","hat":0},{"utterance":"I was really sad too, but at least I can still listen to their Cds.
