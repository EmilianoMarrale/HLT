White Hat: calls for information known or needed. “The facts, just the facts.”

Yellow hat: Yellow Hat symbolizes brightness and optimism. Under this hat you explore the positives and probe for value and benefit.

Black hat: Risks, difficulties, Problems – The risk management Hat, probably the most powerful Hat; a problem however if overused; spot difficulties where things might go wrong, why something may not work, inherently an action hat with the intent to point out issues of risk with intent to overcome them.
Red hat: signifies feelings, hunches and intuition. When using this hat you can express emotions and feelings and share fears, likes, dislikes, loves, and hates.
Green hat: focuses on creativity; the possibilities, alternatives, and new ideas. It’s an opportunity to express new concepts and new perceptions.
Blue hat: is used to manage the thinking process. It’s the control mechanism that ensures the Six Thinking Hats® guidelines are observed.
