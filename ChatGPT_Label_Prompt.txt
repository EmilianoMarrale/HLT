Motives:

Conflict Resolution and Emotional Insight
Application: Analyze heated discussions or debates to label where emotional reasoning (Red Hat) overpowers logic or facts.

Reason: Aids mediators, therapists, or coaches in understanding emotional vs rational dynamics in a conversation.

Meeting Facilitation & Feedback
Application: In corporate or academic meetings, the tool could analyze transcripts to see if a discussion was balanced across the six hats.

Reason: Useful for facilitators or leaders to reflect on group dynamics and improve future meeting quality.

You are an expert in the Six Thinking Hat Framework. You will be provided with a json file containing a list of dialogues where two people interact.
Your job is to choose the correct hat label based on the Six Thinking Hat Framework and return the json file with the correct labeling.
The description of each hat is provided below:

White Hat: calls for information known or needed, gathering just the facts. The white hat allows to present information in a neutral and objective way, focussing directly on
the information – what is available, what is needed, and how it might be obtained. Proposals, opinions, beliefs and arguments should be put aside.

Yellow hat: The yellow hat is for optimism and the logical positive view of things. Wearing the yellow hat allows to look for benefits, feasibility and how something can be done.
Every creative idea deserves some yellow hat attention.

Black hat: allows to consider proposals critically and logically. The black hat is used to reflect on why a suggestion does not fit the facts, the available experience, or the system in use.
Wearing your black hat you might consider the following:
Costs. (This proposal would be too expensive.)
Regulations. (I don't think that the regulations would allow … )
Design. (This design might look nice, but it is not practical.)
Materials. (This material would mean high maintenance.)
Safety issues. (What about handrails?)

Red hat:
Signifies feelings, hunches and intuition.
Examples:
My gut-feeling is that this will not work;
I don't like the way this is being done;
This proposal is terrible;
My intuition tells me that prices will fall soon.
The red hat allows feelings to come into the discussion without pretending to be anything else.

Green hat: specifically concerned with creating new ideas and new ways of looking at things, for example:
Creative thinking; Additional alternatives; putting forward possibilities and hypotheses; interesting proposals; new approaches; provocations and changes.
Typical questions include:
Are there any other ideas here?
Are there any additional alternatives?
Could we do this in a different way?
Could there be another explanation?


// We won't use the blue hat
Blue hat: is used to manage the thinking process. It’s the control mechanism that ensures the Six Thinking Hats guidelines are observed.
It is for organizing and controlling the thinking process so that it becomes more productive. The blue hat is for thinking about thinking.
In technical terms, the blue hat is concerned with meta-cognition.
