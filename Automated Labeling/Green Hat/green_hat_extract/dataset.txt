ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
As I sit here, in early 2003, I have before me several pages of manuscript bearing majestically
encouraging and tactful notes from Ian Tattersal of the American Museum of Natural History
pointing out, inter alia, that Perigueux is not a wineproducing region, that it is inventive but a
touch unorthodox of me to italicize taxonomic divisions above the level of genus and species,
that I have persistently misspelled Olorgesaille, a place that I recently visited, and so on in
similar vein through two chapters of text covering his area of expertise, early humans.

2. Probability: 0.9746
And congratulations.

3. Probability: 0.9986
I am delighted that you could make it.

4. Probability: 0.9931
To begin with, for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble
in an intricate and intriguingly obliging manner to create you.

5. Probability: 0.9964
It's an arrangement so
specialized and particular that it has never been tried before and will only exist this once.

6. Probability: 0.9944
(It is a slightly arresting notion
that if you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers, one atom at a time, you would produce a
mound of fine atomic dust, none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been
you.) Yet somehow for the period of your existence they will answer to a single overarching
impulse: to keep you you.

7. Probability: 0.9850
Still, you may rejoice that it happens at all.

8. Probability: 0.9559
That is of course the miracle of life.

9. Probability: 0.9591
But the fact that you have atoms and that they assemble in
such a willing manner is only part of what got you here.

10. Probability: 0.9875
So at various
periods over the last 3.8 billion years you have abhorred oxygen and then doted on it, grown
fins and limbs and jaunty sails, laid eggs, flicked the air with a forked tongue, been sleek,
been furry, lived underground, lived in trees, been as big as a deer and as small as a mouse,
and a million things more.

11. Probability: 0.9941
It's hard to believe that there was ever a time when I had not seen such an illustration
before, but evidently I had not for I clearly remember being transfixed.

12. Probability: 0.9802
To me that was just a
miracle.

13. Probability: 0.9700
That to me remained the
greatest of all amazements-how scientists work things out.

14. Probability: 0.9761
The idea was to see if it isn't possible to understand and
appreciate-marvel at, enjoy even-the wonder and accomplishments of science at a level that
isn't too technical or demanding, but isn't entirely superficial either.

15. Probability: 0.9642
That was my idea and my hope, and that is what the book that follows is intended to be.

16. Probability: 0.9972
It’s gorgeous.

17. Probability: 0.9960
It’s
almost uncanny.

18. Probability: 0.9534
Now imagine if you can (and of course you can’t) shrinking one of those protons down to a
billionth of its normal size into a space so small that it would make a proton look enormous.

19. Probability: 0.9960
Excellent.

20. Probability: 0.9770
In either case, get ready for a really big bang.

21. Probability: 0.9833
The only space that exists is the space it creates as it goes.

22. Probability: 0.9510
But there is no space, no darkness.

23. Probability: 0.9532
We can’t even ask how long
it has been there—whether it has just lately popped into being, like a good idea, or whether it
has been there forever, quietly awaiting the right moment.

24. Probability: 0.9728
And so, from nothing, our universe begins.

25. Probability: 0.9676
In a single blinding pulse, a moment of glory much too swift and expansive for any form of
words, the singularity assumes heavenly dimensions, space beyond conception.

26. Probability: 0.9966
It is a place of the most wondrous and gratifying possibility,
and beautiful, too.

27. Probability: 0.9630
And it was all done in about the time it takes to make a sandwich.

28. Probability: 0.9506
Even the notion of the Big Bang is quite a
recent one.

29. Probability: 0.9592
The idea had been kicking around since the 1920s, when Georges Lemaître, a
Belgian priest-scholar, first tentatively proposed it, but it didn’t really become an active
notion in cosmology until the mid-1960s when two young radio astronomers made an
extraordinary and inadvertent discovery.

30. Probability: 0.9814
It came from every
point in the sky, day and night, through every season.

31. Probability: 0.9758
They rebuilt instruments, checked circuits, wiggled wires, dusted plugs.

32. Probability: 0.9812
They climbed into the dish and placed duct tape over every seam and rivet.

33. Probability: 0.9732
Gamow
calculated that by the time it crossed the vastness of the cosmos, the radiation would reach
Earth in the form of microwaves.

34. Probability: 0.9645
In his book The Inflationary Universe , Alan Guth provides an analogy that helps to
put this finding in perspective.

35. Probability: 0.9593
Dicke realized at
once what the two young men had found.

36. Probability: 0.9837
It was, rather, a vast, sudden expansion on a whopping
scale.

37. Probability: 0.9772
Others attribute the Big Bang to what they call “a false vacuum” or “a
scalar field” or “vacuum energy”—some quality or thing, at any rate, that introduced a
measure of instability into the nothingness that was.

38. Probability: 0.9675
It seems impossible that you could get
something from nothing, but the fact that once there was nothing and now there is a universe
is evident proof that you can.

39. Probability: 0.9805
He would probably never have
had his great theory except that he happened to attend a lecture on the Big Bang given by
none other than Robert Dicke.

40. Probability: 0.9878
It inflated—in
effect ran away with itself, doubling in size every 10-34seconds.

41. Probability: 0.9891
What is extraordinary from our point of view is how well it turned out for us.

42. Probability: 0.9810
The reason
for this is that the universe bends, in a way we can’t adequately imagine, in conformance with
Einstein’s theory of relativity (which we will get to in due course).

43. Probability: 0.9843
Rather, space
curves, in a way that allows it to be boundless but finite.

44. Probability: 0.9784
It is all something of a challenge to intuition.

45. Probability: 0.9866
Interestingly, the man who found the answer to that question was a cosmologist who
heartily despised the Big Bang as a theory and coined the term “Big Bang” sarcastically, as a
way of mocking it.

46. Probability: 0.9868
2 WELCOME TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM
ASTRONOMERS THESE DAYS can do the most amazing things.

47. Probability: 0.9913
Which is why it is all the more remarkable to reflect that until 1978
no one had ever noticed that Pluto has a moon.

48. Probability: 0.9904
And it wasn’t just any moon.

49. Probability: 0.9626
Since previously the space occupied by the moon and the space
occupied by Pluto were thought to be one and the same, it meant that Pluto was much smaller
than anyone had supposed—smaller even than Mercury.

50. Probability: 0.9954
One nice touch about Christy’s discovery was that it happened in Flagstaff, for it was there
in 1930 that Pluto had been found in the first place.

51. Probability: 0.9912
However, in 1929, partly as a way of deflecting attention away
from the Mars canal saga (which by now had become a serious embarrassment), the Lowell
Observatory directors decided to resume the search and to that end hired a young man from
Kansas named Clyde Tombaugh.

52. Probability: 0.9906
It was named Pluto at least partly because the first two letters made a
monogram from Lowell’s initials.

53. Probability: 0.9982
(It
would receive so little sunlight that it would have almost none to reflect.) The idea is that it
wouldn’t be a conventional planet like Jupiter or Saturn—it’s much too far away for that;
we’re talking perhaps 4.5 trillion miles—but more like a sun that never quite made it.

54. Probability: 0.9568
Leonard in 1930,
but the name honors Gerard Kuiper, a Dutch native working in America, who expanded the
idea.

55. Probability: 0.9613
Whereas the other planets orbit on more or less the same plane, Pluto’s
orbital path is tipped (as it were) out of alignment at an angle of seventeen degrees, like the
brim of a hat tilted rakishly on someone’s head.

56. Probability: 0.9931
This alone makes it extremely anomalous; it means that
our planetary system consists of four rocky inner planets, four gassy outer giants, and a tiny,
solitary iceball.

57. Probability: 0.9882
It’s almost beyond imagining.

58. Probability: 0.9933
Let’s imagine, for purposes of edification and entertainment, that
we are about to go on a journey by rocketship.

59. Probability: 0.9672
The reason the Voyager craft were launched when they were (in August and September
1977) was that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were aligned in a way that happens only
once every 175 years.

60. Probability: 0.9968
This enabled the two Voyagers to use a “gravity assist” technique in
which the craft were successively flung from one gassy giant to the next in a kind of cosmic
version of “crack the whip.” Even so, it took them nine years to reach Uranus and a dozen to
cross the orbit of Pluto.

61. Probability: 0.9536
Its existence is probable but entirely hypothetical.*
About all that can be said with confidence about the Oort cloud is that it starts somewhere
beyond Pluto and stretches some two light-years out into the cosmos.

62. Probability: 0.9863
It is a remarkable thought that that
distant tiny twinkle has enough gravity to hold all these comets in orbit.

63. Probability: 0.9576
It is headed for, of all places,
Manson, Iowa.

64. Probability: 0.9562
In the 1960s, a professor at Cornell named
Frank Drake, excited by such whopping numbers, worked out a famous equation designed to
calculate the chances of advanced life in the cosmos based on a series of diminishing
probabilities.

65. Probability: 0.9986
What an interesting and exciting thought.

66. Probability: 0.9675
Carl Sagan calculated the
number of probable planets in the universe at large at 10 billion trillion—a number vastly
beyond imagining.

67. Probability: 0.9605
But what is equally beyond imagining is the amount of space through
which they are lightly scattered.

68. Probability: 0.9884
3 THE REVEREND EVANS’S UNIVERSE
WHEN THE SKIES are clear and the Moon is not too bright, the Reverend Robert Evans, a
quiet and cheerful man, lugs a bulky telescope onto the back deck of his home in the Blue
Mountains of Australia, about fifty miles west of Sydney, and does an extraordinary thing.

69. Probability: 0.9911
What Bob Evans does better than anyone else who
has ever tried is spot these moments of celestial farewell.

70. Probability: 0.9656
But by night he is, in his unassuming way, a titan of the skies.

71. Probability: 0.9840
To understand what a feat this is, imagine a standard dining room table covered in a black
tablecloth and someone throwing a handful of salt across it.

72. Probability: 0.9905
The scattered grains can be
thought of as a galaxy.

73. Probability: 0.9578
Now imagine fifteen hundred more tables like the first one—enough to
fill a Wal-Mart parking lot, say, or to make a single line two miles long—each with a random
array of salt across it.

74. Probability: 0.9613
He nodded frankly again and grinned, then asked me if I’d like to see his telescope.

75. Probability: 0.9840
In fact, he led me not outside but to a crowded storeroom
off the kitchen where he keeps his books and papers and where his telescope—a white
cylinder that is about the size and shape of a household hot-water tank—rests in a homemade,
swiveling plywood mount.

76. Probability: 0.9839
Between the overhang of the roof and the feathery tops of eucalyptus
trees growing up from the slope below, he has only a letter-box view of the sky, but he says it
is more than good enough for his purposes.

77. Probability: 0.9857
And there, when the skies are clear and the Moon
not too bright, he finds his supernovae.

78. Probability: 0.9954
The term supernova was coined in the 1930s by a memorably odd astrophysicist named
Fritz Zwicky.

79. Probability: 0.9950
But Zwicky was also capable of insights of the most startling brilliance.

80. Probability: 0.9982
Improbably he wondered if the
neutron—the subatomic particle that had just been discovered in England by James
Chadwick, and was thus both novel and rather fashionable—might be at the heart of things.

81. Probability: 0.9822
It
occurred to him that if a star collapsed to the sort of densities found in the core of atoms, the
result would be an unimaginably compacted core.

82. Probability: 0.9560
A spoonful!

83. Probability: 0.9894
Zwicky
realized that after the collapse of such a star there would be a huge amount of energy left
over—enough to make the biggest bang in the universe.

84. Probability: 0.9572
He called these resultant explosions
supernovae.

85. Probability: 0.9872
They would be—they are—the biggest events in creation.

86. Probability: 0.9902
These ideas were revolutionary to say the
least.

87. Probability: 0.9785
With a sixteen-
inch telescope, such as Evans uses, you begin to count not in stars but in galaxies.

88. Probability: 0.9771
Finding a supernova therefore was a little bit like standing
on the observation platform of the Empire State Building with a telescope and searching
windows around Manhattan in the hope of finding, let us say, someone lighting a twenty-first-
birthday cake.

89. Probability: 0.9657
So when a hopeful and softspoken minister got in touch to ask if they had any usable field
charts for hunting supernovae, the astronomical community thought he was out of his mind.

90. Probability: 0.9576
It was of course Robert Evans on
his eucalypt-scented hillside who spotted it.

91. Probability: 0.9918
“There’s something satisfying, I think,” Evans said, “about the idea of light traveling for
millions of years through space and just at the right moment as it reaches Earth someone
looks at the right bit of sky and sees it.

92. Probability: 0.9981
Perlmutter devised a nifty system using sophisticated computers and
charge-coupled devices—in essence, really good digital cameras.

93. Probability: 0.9732
Now even amateurs
are finding supernovae with charge-coupled devices.

94. Probability: 0.9790
I had
imagined that if there were an explosion there we would have 4.3 years to watch the light of
this magnificent event spreading across the sky, as if tipped from a giant can.

95. Probability: 0.9665
One was a blast in 1054 that created the Crab Nebula.

96. Probability: 0.9847
Supernovae provided the explanation, and it was an English cosmologist almost
as singular in manner as Fritz Zwicky who figured it out.

97. Probability: 0.9946
It was he who coined the term “Big Bang,” in a moment of facetiousness, for a radio
broadcast in 1952.

98. Probability: 0.9714
Hoyle also realized that if stars imploded they
would liberate huge amounts of heat—100 million degrees or more, enough to begin to
generate the heavier elements in a process known as nucleosynthesis.

99. Probability: 0.9905
For
this work, W.

100. Probability: 0.9717
Fowler, one of his collaborators, received a Nobel Prize.

101. Probability: 0.9713
This was the moment of conception for our planet.

102. Probability: 0.9565
It all happened remarkably quickly.

103. Probability: 0.9611
Hardly the sort
of stuff that we would associate with life, and yet from this noxious stew life formed.

104. Probability: 0.9771
But
somehow life did.

105. Probability: 0.9923
It was a singularly hostile
environment and yet somehow life got going.

106. Probability: 0.9902
Some tiny bag of chemicals twitched and
became animate.

107. Probability: 0.9692
Now if you imagine a
line connecting the three principals of this exercise-that is, you and I and the Moon-it forms a triangle.

108. Probability: 0.9658
In measuring a degree of meridian, the surveyors would create a sort of chain of triangles marching across
the landscape.

109. Probability: 0.9908
Halley was an exceptional figure.

110. Probability: 0.9849
In the course of a long and productive career, he was a
sea captain, a cartographer, a professor of geometry at the University of Oxford, deputy
controller of the Royal Mint, astronomer royal, and inventor of the deep-sea diving bell.

111. Probability: 0.9977
He invented the weather map and actuarial table, proposed methods for
working out the age of the Earth and its distance from the Sun, even devised a practical
method for keeping fish fresh out of season.

112. Probability: 0.9738
Wren generously offered a prize worth forty shillings (equivalent to a couple
of weeks’ pay) to whichever of the men could provide a solution.

113. Probability: 0.9953
Hooke, who was well known for taking credit for ideas that weren’t necessarily his own,
claimed that he had solved the problem already but declined now to share it on the interesting
and inventive grounds that it would rob others of the satisfaction of discovering the answer for
themselves.

114. Probability: 0.9896
He built his own laboratory, the first
at Cambridge, but then engaged in the most bizarre experiments.

115. Probability: 0.9593
Once he inserted a bodkin—
a long needle of the sort used for sewing leather—into his eye socket and rubbed it around
“betwixt my eye and the bone as near to [the] backside of my eye as I could” just to see what
would happen.

116. Probability: 0.9618
Set atop these odd beliefs and quirky traits, however, was the mind of a supreme genius—
though even when working in conventional channels he often showed a tendency to
peculiarity.

117. Probability: 0.9959
As a student, frustrated by the limitations of conventional mathematics, he
invented an entirely new form, the calculus, but then told no one about it for twenty-seven
years.

118. Probability: 0.9576
These were not mere
dabblings but wholehearted devotions.

119. Probability: 0.9664
He spent endless hours
studying the floor plan of the lost Temple of King Solomon in Jerusalem (teaching himself
Hebrew in the process, the better to scan original texts) in the belief that it held mathematical
clues to the dates of the second coming of Christ and the end of the world.

120. Probability: 0.9787
This was astounding—like someone saying he had found a cure for cancer but couldn’t
remember where he had put the formula.

121. Probability: 0.9932
He did as promised, but then did much more.

122. Probability: 0.9916
Principia was one of those moments.

123. Probability: 0.9616
It made Newton instantly famous.

124. Probability: 0.9877
Suddenly every motion in the universe made
sense.

125. Probability: 0.9708
It may not seem like it, but as you sit here now you are
pulling everything around you—walls, ceiling, lamp, pet cat—toward you with your own little
(indeed, very little) gravitational field.

126. Probability: 0.9969
This can be expressed with the formula
F = Gmm
R
2
which is of course way beyond anything that most of us could make practical use of, but at
least we can appreciate that it is elegantly compact.

127. Probability: 0.9938
Principia’s production was not without drama.

128. Probability: 0.9882
Only with some frantic shuttle diplomacy and the most liberal
applications of flattery did Halley manage finally to extract the concluding volume from the
erratic professor.

129. Probability: 0.9921
This was the suggestion that the Earth is not quite round.

130. Probability: 0.9861
As a young man Norwood had traveled to Bermuda
with a diving bell modeled on Halley’s device, intending to make a fortune scooping pearls
from the seabed.

131. Probability: 0.9628
Starting with his back against the Tower of London, Norwood spent two devoted years
marching 208 miles north to York, repeatedly stretching and measuring a length of chain as
he went, all the while making the most meticulous adjustments for the rise and fall of the land
and the meanderings of the road.

132. Probability: 0.9750
From this, he reasoned he could determine the length of one degree of the Earth’s
meridian and thus calculate the distance around the whole.

133. Probability: 0.9715
successful planter and devoting his leisure hours to his first love, trigonometry.

134. Probability: 0.9965
There, the astronomer Jean Picard devised an impressively complicated method of
triangulation involving quadrants, pendulum clocks, zenith sectors, and telescopes (for
observing the motions of the moons of Jupiter).

135. Probability: 0.9885
They chose the Andes because they needed to measure near the equator, to determine if
there really was a difference in sphericity there, and because they reasoned that mountains
would give them good sightlines.

136. Probability: 0.9668
Peruvians refer to their
landscape as muy accidentado —“much accidented”—and this it most certainly is.

137. Probability: 0.9823
This was more than a curious fact.

138. Probability: 0.9614
Maskelyne knew just such a person—the
astronomer and surveyor Charles Mason.

139. Probability: 0.9763
Undaunted, Le Gentil continued on to India to await the next transit in 1769.

140. Probability: 0.9639
With eight
years to prepare, he erected a first-rate viewing station, tested and retested his instruments,
and had everything in a state of perfect readiness.

141. Probability: 0.9755
Mason and Maskelyne formed a solid
friendship and spent several happy, and possibly even mildly useful, weeks charting tidal
flows.

142. Probability: 0.9568
The successful charting of a
Venusian transit fell instead to a little-known Yorkshire-born sea captain named James Cook,
who watched the 1769 transit from a sunny hilltop in Tahiti, and then went on to chart and
claim Australia for the British crown.

143. Probability: 0.9940
Of Dixon the Dictionary of National Biography
notes intriguingly that he was “said to have been born in a coal mine,” but then leaves it to the
reader’s imagination to supply a plausible explanatory circumstance, and adds that he died at
Durham in 1777.

144. Probability: 0.9583
It was essentially just a confusing mass of numbers, but Hutton
noticed that if he used a pencil to connect points of equal height, it all became much more
orderly.

145. Probability: 0.9973
He had invented contour lines.

146. Probability: 0.9714
For convenience, Hutton had assumed that the mountain had
the same density as ordinary stone, about 2.5 times that of water, but this was little more than
an educated guess.

147. Probability: 0.9945
Among a great deal else, he perceived the wavelike nature of earthquakes, conducted much
original research into magnetism and gravity, and, quite extraordinarily, envisioned the
possibility of black holes two hundred years before anyone else—a leap of intuitive deduction
that not even Newton could make.

148. Probability: 0.9834
When the German-born musician William Herschel
decided his real interest in life was astronomy, it was Michell to whom he turned for
instruction in making telescopes, a kindness for which planetary science has been in his debt
ever since.4
But of all that Michell accomplished, nothing was more ingenious or had greater impact
than a machine he designed and built for measuring the mass of the Earth.

149. Probability: 0.9596
Born into a life of sumptuous privilege—his grandfathers
were dukes, respectively, of Devonshire and Kent—he was the most gifted English scientist
of his age, but also the strangest.

150. Probability: 0.9804
Excitedly the Austrian began to babble out praise.

151. Probability: 0.9815
Instead it became Uranus.

152. Probability: 0.9690
In America, Benjamin Franklin famously risked his life by flying a kite in an electrical
storm.

153. Probability: 0.9834
In his secretiveness he
didn’t merely resemble Newton, but actively exceeded him.

154. Probability: 0.9865
Among much else, and without telling anyone, Cavendish discovered or anticipated the law
of the conservation of energy, Ohm’s law, Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures, Richter’s Law
of Reciprocal Proportions, Charles’s Law of Gases, and the principles of electrical
conductivity.

155. Probability: 0.9948
It incorporated weights,
counterweights, pendulums, shafts, and torsion wires.

156. Probability: 0.9925
The idea was to
measure the gravitational deflection of the smaller spheres by the larger ones, which would
allow the first measurement of the elusive force known as the gravitational constant, and from
which the weight (strictly speaking, the mass)5 of the Earth could be deduced.

157. Probability: 0.9564
What Cavendish was trying to do was measure gravity at this
extremely featherweight level.

158. Probability: 0.9898
Not a whisper of disturbance could be allowed into the room
containing the apparatus, so Cavendish took up a position in an adjoining room and made his
observations with a telescope aimed through a peephole.

159. Probability: 0.9890
Human beings would split the atom and invent television, nylon, and instant
coffee before they could figure out the age of their own planet.

160. Probability: 0.9907
To understand why, we must travel north to Scotland and begin with a brilliant and genial
man, of whom few have ever heard, who had just invented a new science called geology.

161. Probability: 0.9622
Travel to the Moon and you will be much lighter but no less massive.

162. Probability: 0.9977
Yet almost singlehandedly, and quite brilliantly, he created the science of geology and
transformed our understanding of the Earth.

163. Probability: 0.9969
It was while puzzling over these matters that Hutton had a series of exceptional insights.

164. Probability: 0.9628
He realized that if such a process were carried to its natural
conclusion then Earth would eventually be worn quite smooth.

165. Probability: 0.9772
Clearly there had to be some additional process, some form of renewal and
uplift, that created new hills and mountains to keep the cycle going.

166. Probability: 0.9598
It is not too much to say that geologists
wouldn’t grasp the full implications of this thought for two hundred years, when finally they
adopted plate tectonics.

167. Probability: 0.9953
There were enough
insights here to transform utterly our understanding of the Earth.

168. Probability: 0.9757
In 1785, Hutton worked his ideas up into a long paper, which was read at consecutive
meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

169. Probability: 0.9716
Here, in part, is how he presented it to his audience:
In the one case, the forming cause is in the body which is separated; for, after the
body has been actuated by heat, it is by the reaction of the proper matter of the
body, that the chasm which constitutes the vein is formed.

170. Probability: 0.9900
And how.

171. Probability: 0.9856
The idea was to meet once a month to swap geological notions over a glass or two of
Madeira and a convivial dinner.

172. Probability: 0.9947
The price of the meal was set at a deliberately hefty fifteen
shillings to discourage those whose qualifications were merely cerebral.

173. Probability: 0.9932
It is hard to imagine now, but geology excited the nineteenth century—positively gripped
it—in a way that no science ever had before or would again.

174. Probability: 0.9848
Then he discovered
an interest in rocks and became with rather astounding swiftness a titan of geological
thinking.

175. Probability: 0.9975
Buckland was a bit of a charming oddity.

176. Probability: 0.9942
Depending on
whim and availability, guests to Buckland’s house might be served baked guinea pig, mice in
batter, roasted hedgehog, or boiled Southeast Asian sea slug.

177. Probability: 0.9713
Almost
inevitably, he became the leading authority on coprolites—fossilized feces—and had a table
made entirely out of his collection of specimens.

178. Probability: 0.9702
Buckland made a flour paste,
which she spread across the table, while the Reverend Buckland fetched the family tortoise.

179. Probability: 0.9729
Plunking it onto the paste, they goaded it forward and discovered to their delight that its
footprints did indeed match those of the fossil Buckland had been studying.

180. Probability: 0.9718
But with the rise of geological prospecting elsewhere,
names began to creep in from all over.Jurassic refers to the Jura Mountains on the border of
France and Switzerland.Permian recalls the former Russian province of Perm in the Ural
Mountains.

181. Probability: 0.9555
ForCretaceous (from the Latin for “chalk”) we are indebted to a Belgian geologist
with the perky name of J.

182. Probability: 0.9786
The “-
cene” terminations were thus something of a compromise.

183. Probability: 0.9942
At least today we can bring some sophisticated dating techniques to the table.

184. Probability: 0.9715
When
Buckland speculated on the antiquity of an Ichthyosaurus skeleton he could do no better than
suggest that it had lived somewhere between “ten thousand, or more than ten thousand times
ten thousand” years earlier.

185. Probability: 0.9745
created at midday on October 23, 4004B.C.

186. Probability: 0.9605
One of the better early attempts at dating the planet came from the ever-reliable Edmond
Halley, who in 1715 suggested that if you divided the total amount of salt in the world’s seas
by the amount added each year, you would get the number of years that the oceans had been
in existence, which would give you a rough idea of Earth’s age.

187. Probability: 0.9619
This was
of course a wild underestimate, but a radical notion nonetheless, and Buffon found himself
threatened with excommunication for expressing it.

188. Probability: 0.9683
Kelvin was one of the most extraordinary figures of the nineteenth century—indeed of any
century.

189. Probability: 0.9820
There Kelvin proved himself such a
prodigy that he was admitted to Glasgow University at the exceedingly tender age of ten.

190. Probability: 0.9886
By
the time he had reached his early twenties, he had studied at institutions in London and Paris,
graduated from Cambridge (where he won the university’s top prizes for rowing and
mathematics, and somehow found time to launch a musical society as well), been elected a
fellow of Peterhouse, and written (in French and English) a dozen papers in pure and applied
mathematics of such dazzling originality that he had to publish them anonymously for fear of
embarrassing his superiors.

191. Probability: 0.9763
Among much else, he suggested the method
that led directly to the invention of refrigeration, devised the scale of absolute temperature
that still bears his name, invented the boosting devices that allowed telegrams to be sent
across oceans, and made innumerable improvements to shipping and navigation, from the
invention of a popular marine compass to the creation of the first depth sounder.

192. Probability: 0.9779
His first effort, in 1862 for an article in a
popular magazine called Macmillan’s , suggested that the Earth was 98 million years old, but
cautiously allowed that the figure could be as low as 20 million years or as high as 400
million.

193. Probability: 0.9526
Therefore it followed that the Sun and its
planets were relatively, but inescapably, youthful.

194. Probability: 0.9623
Thomas Jefferson
incorporated a furious (and, unless the context is understood, quite bewildering) rebuttal in his
Notes on the State of Virginia , and induced his New Hampshire friend General John Sullivan
to send twenty soldiers into the northern woods to find a bull moose to present to Buffon as
proof of the stature and majesty of American quadrupeds.

195. Probability: 0.9886
The moose, when shot, unfortunately lacked the imposing horns that
Jefferson had specified, but Sullivan thoughtfully included a rack of antlers from an elk or
stag with the suggestion that these be attached instead.

196. Probability: 0.9881
They overestimated its size by a
factor of six and gave it frightening claws, which in fact came from a Megalonyx, or giant
ground sloth, found nearby.

197. Probability: 0.9984
Rather remarkably, they persuaded themselves that the animal
had enjoyed “the agility and ferocity of the tiger,” and portrayed it in illustrations as pouncing
with feline grace onto prey from boulders.

198. Probability: 0.9889
When tusks were discovered, they were forced into
the animal’s head in any number of inventive ways.

199. Probability: 0.9973
One restorer screwed the tusks in upside
down, like the fangs of a saber-toothed cat, which gave it a satisfyingly aggressive aspect.

200. Probability: 0.9970
Another arranged the tusks so that they curved backwards on the engaging theory that the
creature had been aquatic and had used them to anchor itself to trees while dozing.

201. Probability: 0.9933
Cuvier was already dazzling people with his genius for taking
heaps of disarticulated bones and whipping them into shapely forms.

202. Probability: 0.9907
Realizing that no one in America had thought to write
a formal description of the lumbering beast, Cuvier did so, and thus became its official
discoverer.

203. Probability: 0.9936
He called it a mastodon (which means, a touch unexpectedly, “nipple-teeth”).

204. Probability: 0.9849
So when it was put to him that there
might be scientific and political value in sending a party to explore the interior of America
beyond the Mississippi he leapt at the idea, hoping the intrepid adventurers would find herds
of healthy mastodons and other outsized creatures grazing on the bounteous plains.

205. Probability: 0.9730
In the same year—in fact, the same month—that the aristocratic and celebrated Cuvier was
propounding his extinction theories in Paris, on the other side of the English Channel a rather
more obscure Englishman was having an insight into the value of fossils that would also have
lasting ramifications.

206. Probability: 0.9711
On the evening of January 5, 1796, he was sitting in a coaching inn in Somerset
when he jotted down the notion that would eventually make his reputation.

207. Probability: 0.9793
Smith’s
insight was to realize that the answer lay with fossils.

208. Probability: 0.9856
Drawing on his knowledge as a surveyor, Smith began at once to make a map of
Britain’s rock strata, which would be published after many trials in 1815 and would become a
cornerstone of modern geology.

209. Probability: 0.9552
In that same year, 1818, Caspar Wistar died, but he did gain a certain
unexpected immortality when a botanist named Thomas Nuttall named a delightful climbing
shrub after him.

210. Probability: 0.9821
It was the start of a remarkable career.

211. Probability: 0.9856
(She is commonly held to be the source for the
famous tongue twister “She sells seashells on the seashore.”) She would also find the first
plesiosaurus, another marine monster, and one of the first and best pterodactyls.

212. Probability: 0.9832
It wasn’t simply that Anning was good at spotting fossils—though she was unrivalled at
that—but that she could extract them with the greatest delicacy and without damage.

213. Probability: 0.9641
The plesiosaur alone took her ten years of patient excavation.

214. Probability: 0.9549
Although untrained, Anning was also able to provide competent drawings and descriptions for
scholars.

215. Probability: 0.9781
Mantell went for a stroll down a nearby lane and in a pile of
rubble that had been left to fill potholes she found a curious object—a curved brown stone,
about the size of a small walnut.

216. Probability: 0.9832
Knowing her husband’s interest in fossils, and thinking it
might be one, she took it to him.

217. Probability: 0.9559
He was right on all
counts, but these were bold conclusions since nothing like it had been seen before or even
imagined.

218. Probability: 0.9909
And so Mantell’s creature became Iguanodon , after
a basking tropical lizard to which it was not in any manner related.

219. Probability: 0.9779
It was the Megalosaurus, and the name was actually suggested to Buckland by his friend Dr.

220. Probability: 0.9722
In some desperation Mantell hit on the idea of turning his house into a museum and
charging admission, then belatedly realized that such a mercenary act would ruin his standing
as a gentleman, not to mention as a scientist, and so he allowed people to visit the house for
free.

221. Probability: 0.9766
Remarkably, his troubles were only just beginning.

222. Probability: 0.9561
Not many
people travel there these days, but once this was one of the most popular attractions in
London—in effect, as Richard Fortey has noted, the world’s first theme park.

223. Probability: 0.9935
The iguanodon’s thumb has been placed on its nose,
as a kind of spike, and it stands on four sturdy legs, making it look like a rather stout and
awkwardly overgrown dog.

224. Probability: 0.9829
At the time of the dinosaurs’ construction, Sydenham was on the edge of London and its
spacious park was considered an ideal place to re-erect the famous Crystal Palace, the glass
and cast-iron structure that had been the centerpiece of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and from
which the new park naturally took its name.

225. Probability: 0.9960
The dinosaurs, built of concrete, were a kind of
bonus attraction.

226. Probability: 0.9606
On New Year’s Eve 1853 a famous dinner for twenty-one prominent
scientists was held inside the unfinished iguanodon.

227. Probability: 0.9524
He was a born anatomist and so devoted to his studies that he sometimes illicitly borrowed
limbs, organs, and other parts from cadavers and took them home for leisurely dissection.

228. Probability: 0.9873
What the occupants had to say upon finding an unattached head rolling to a
halt at their feet can only be imagined.

229. Probability: 0.9906
Owen swiftly distinguished himself with his powers of organization and deduction.

230. Probability: 0.9924
At the
same time he showed himself to be a peerless anatomist with instincts for reconstruction
almost on a par with the great Cuvier in Paris.

231. Probability: 0.9592
Once his
wife returned home to find a freshly deceased rhinoceros filling the front hallway.

232. Probability: 0.9784
Altogether he produced some six hundred anatomical
papers, a prodigious output.

233. Probability: 0.9760
But it was for his work with dinosaurs that Owen is remembered.

234. Probability: 0.9652
Another, more excusable error (given the paucity of specimens at the time)
was that dinosaurs constitute not one but two orders of reptiles: the bird-hipped ornithischians
and the lizard-hipped saurischians.

235. Probability: 0.9543
While crossing Clapham Common in a carriage,
he somehow fell from his seat, grew entangled in the reins, and was dragged at a gallop over
rough ground by the panicked horses.

236. Probability: 0.9942
Capitalizing on Mantell’s enfeebled state, Owen set about systematically expunging
Mantell’s contributions from the record, renaming species that Mantell had named years
before and claiming credit for their discovery for himself.

237. Probability: 0.9845
His deformed spine was removed and sent to the Royal College of Surgeons
where—and now here’s an irony for you—it was placed in the care of Richard Owen, director
of the college’s Hunterian Museum.

238. Probability: 0.9806
Though the piece carried no byline, the
style was Owen’s and no one in the world of the natural sciences doubted the authorship.

239. Probability: 0.9824
Owen had been at that meeting, but failed to mention
this when he presented a report of his own to the Royal Society—in which, not incidentally,
he rechristened the creature Belemnites owenii in his own honor.

240. Probability: 0.9801
The grand and beloved
Gothic heap in South Kensington, opened in 1880, is almost entirely a testament to his vision.

241. Probability: 0.9524
Owen’s plan was to welcome everyone, even to the point of encouraging workingmen
to visit in the evening, and to devote most of the museum’s space to public displays.

242. Probability: 0.9908
He even
proposed, very radically, to put informative labels on each display so that people could
appreciate what they were viewing.

243. Probability: 0.9935
By making the
Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of
what museums are for.

244. Probability: 0.9907
At one point he
ran into a party of suspicious Crow Indians, but he managed to win them over by repeatedly
taking out and replacing his false teeth.

245. Probability: 0.9759
Recognizing the bones as coming from a “gigantic saurian,” Lakes thoughtfully dispatched
some samples to both Marsh and Cope.

246. Probability: 0.9778
Seldom—perhaps never—has science been driven forward more swiftly and successfully by
animosity.

247. Probability: 0.9810
Between them they
managed to “discover” a species calledUintatheres anceps no fewer than twenty-two times.

248. Probability: 0.9937
Indeed, to a surprising extent it had only just begun.

249. Probability: 0.9846
They were so numerous, in fact, that
someone had built a cabin out of them—hence the name.

250. Probability: 0.9874
Samuel Haughton, a respected geologist at Trinity College
in Dublin, announced an estimated age for the Earth of 2,300 million years—way beyond
anything anybody else was suggesting.

251. Probability: 0.9665
When this was drawn to his attention, he recalculated
using the same data and put the figure at 153 million years.

252. Probability: 0.9904
Just when matters seemed most intractably confused, along came another extraordinary
figure with a novel approach.

253. Probability: 0.9527
He was a bluff and brilliant New Zealand farm boy named
Ernest Rutherford, and he produced pretty well irrefutable evidence that the Earth was at least
many hundreds of millions of years old, probably rather more.

254. Probability: 0.9987
Remarkably, his evidence was based on alchemy—natural, spontaneous, scientifically
credible, and wholly non-occult, but alchemy nonetheless.

255. Probability: 0.9917
Perhaps nothing better typifies the strange and often accidental nature of chemical science
in its early days than a discovery made by a German named Hennig Brand in 1675.

256. Probability: 0.9678
Brand
became convinced that gold could somehow be distilled from human urine.

257. Probability: 0.9938
None of it yielded
gold, of course, but a strange and interesting thing did happen.

258. Probability: 0.9785
In the 1750s a Swedish chemist named Karl
(or Carl) Scheele devised a way to manufacture phosphorus in bulk without the slop or smell
of urine.

259. Probability: 0.9725
A poor pharmacist
with little in the way of advanced apparatus, he discovered eight elements—chlorine, fluorine,
manganese, barium, molybdenum, tungsten, nitrogen, and oxygen—and got credit for none of
them.

260. Probability: 0.9746
Even more remarkable was Scheele’s failure to receive credit for the
discovery of chlorine.

261. Probability: 0.9806
Someone of insight was needed to thrust chemistry into the modern age, and it was the
French who provided him.

262. Probability: 0.9687
Three years after embarking on this lucrative career path, he married the fourteen-year-old
daughter of one of his bosses.

263. Probability: 0.9914
Madame
Lavoisier had an incisive intellect and soon was working productively alongside her husband.

264. Probability: 0.9929
Somehow
Lavoisier also found the time to be commissioner of gunpowder, supervise the building of a
wall around Paris to deter smugglers, help found the metric system, and coauthor the
handbook Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique , which became the bible for agreeing on the
names of the elements.

265. Probability: 0.9676
It certainly wasn’t for want of beakers.

266. Probability: 0.9755
Lavoisier had thirteen thousand of them in what was, to an almost preposterous degree, the
finest private laboratory in existence.

267. Probability: 0.9924
Instead he took the discoveries of others and made sense of them.

268. Probability: 0.9908
And his fancy equipment did in fact come in very handy.

269. Probability: 0.9920
They determined, for instance, that a rusting object doesn’t lose weight, as
everyone had long assumed, but gains weight—an extraordinary discovery.

270. Probability: 0.9912
This became known as the conservation of mass, and it was a revolutionary concept.

271. Probability: 0.9937
Capitalizing on this, in 1791 Marat, now a leading voice in the National
Assembly, denounced Lavoisier and suggested that it was well past time for his hanging.

272. Probability: 0.9542
Under questioning the
sculptor admitted that he had used the head of the mathematician and philosopher the Marquis
de Condorcet—apparently he had a spare—in the hope that no one would notice or, having
noticed, would care.

273. Probability: 0.9791
Theaters put on “laughing gas
evenings” where volunteers could refresh themselves with a robust inhalation and then
entertain the audience with their comical staggerings.

274. Probability: 0.9678
(This was slightly less true in continental Europe than in Britain, but only slightly.) It is
perhaps telling that one of the most important observations of the century, Brownian motion,
which established the active nature of molecules, was made not by a chemist but by a Scottish
botanist, Robert Brown.

275. Probability: 0.9925
The cause of this perpetual motion—namely the actions of invisible molecules—was
long a mystery.)
Things might have been worse had it not been for a splendidly improbable character named
Count von Rumford, who, despite the grandeur of his title, began life in Woburn,
Massachusetts, in 1753 as plain Benjamin Thompson.

276. Probability: 0.9666
He decamped first to England and then to Germany, where he served as a military advisor
to the government of Bavaria, so impressing the authorities that in 1791 he was named Count
von Rumford of the Holy Roman Empire.

277. Probability: 0.9654
While in Munich, he also designed and laid out the
famous park known as the English Garden.

278. Probability: 0.9948
He
also invented several useful objects, including a drip coffeemaker, thermal underwear, and a
type of range still known as the Rumford fireplace.

279. Probability: 0.9592
In 1805, during a sojourn in France, he
wooed and married Madame Lavoisier, widow of Antoine-Laurent.

280. Probability: 0.9798
Soon after taking up his position, Davy began to bang out new elements one after
another—potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and aluminum or aluminium,
depending on which branch of English you favor.1 He discovered so many elements not so
much because he was serially astute as because he developed an ingenious technique of
applying electricity to a molten substance—electrolysis, as it is known.

281. Probability: 0.9920
This is a fairly extraordinary fact.

282. Probability: 0.9739
Until
well into the second half of the century, the formula H O might mean water to one chemist
2 2
but hydrogen peroxide to another.

283. Probability: 0.9734
C H could signify ethylene or marsh gas.

288. Probability: 0.9980
Suddenly the idea seemed brilliant and
wondrously perceptive.

This instantly showed one set of
relationships when read up and down and another when read from side to side.

290. Probability: 0.9796
Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe, and yet
no one would guess as much for another thirty years.

291. Probability: 0.9791
Helium, the second most abundant
element, had only been found the year before—its existence hadn’t even been suspected
before that—and then not on Earth but in the Sun, where it was found with a spectroscope
during a solar eclipse, which is why it honors the Greek sun god Helios.

292. Probability: 0.9968
In Mendeleyev’s day
just sixty-three elements were known, but part of his cleverness was to realize that the
elements as then known didn’t make a complete picture, that many pieces were missing.

293. Probability: 0.9590
The nineteenth century held one last great surprise for chemists.

294. Probability: 0.9592
When he took the plate out some time later, he was surprised to discover
that the salts had burned an impression in it, just as if the plate had been exposed to light.

295. Probability: 0.9960
Considering the importance of what he had found, Becquerel did a very strange thing: he
turned the matter over to a graduate student for investigation.

296. Probability: 0.9546
Fortunately the student was a
recent émigré from Poland named Marie Curie.

297. Probability: 0.9592
What she and her husband
couldn’t know—what no one could know until Einstein explained things the following
decade—was that the rocks were converting mass into energy in an exceedingly efficient way.

298. Probability: 0.9601
Marie Curie dubbed the effect “radioactivity.” In the process of their work, the Curies also
found two new elements—polonium, which they named after her native country, and radium.

299. Probability: 0.9843
This was truly
extraordinary.

300. Probability: 0.9915
It was alchemy, pure and simple; no one had ever imagined that such a thing
could happen naturally and spontaneously.

301. Probability: 0.9545
Rutherford was there to talk about his new
disintegration theory of radioactivity, as part of which he brought out his piece of pitchblende.

302. Probability: 0.9986
Tactfully—for the aging Kelvin was present, if not always fully awake—Rutherford noted
that Kelvin himself had suggested that the discovery of some other source of heat would
throw his calculations out.

303. Probability: 0.9800
They had discovered the X ray, the cathode ray, the electron, and
radioactivity, invented the ohm, the watt, the Kelvin, the joule, the amp, and the little erg.

Gibbs’s Equilibrium has been called “the Principia of
thermodynamics,” but for reasons that defy speculation Gibbs chose to publish these
landmark observations in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences,
a journal that managed to be obscure even in Connecticut, which is why Planck did not hear
of him until too late.

It occurred to
Michelson that for half the year the Earth is traveling toward the Sun and for half the year it is
moving away from it, and he reasoned that if you took careful enough measurements at
opposite seasons and compared light’s travel time between the two, you would have your
answer.

314. Probability: 0.9917
Michelson talked Alexander Graham Bell, newly enriched inventor of the telephone, into
providing the funds to build an ingenious and sensitive instrument of Michelson’s own
devising called an interferometer, which could measure the velocity of light with great
precision.

315. Probability: 0.9997
This was a novel concept, and a good one.

316. Probability: 0.9564
In the short term it would
help to provide a solution to the puzzle of the Michelson-Morley experiments in that it
demonstrated that light needn’t be a wave after all.

In the longer term it would lay the

Actually, what occurred to Einstein was something more like the beginning of a solution to
the problem of gravity, since it had been evident to him from the outset that one thing missing

Matters were not helped, as David Bodanis points
out in his superb book E=mc2 , when the New York Times decided to do a story, and—for

Hubble’s luck was to come along soon after an ingenious woman named Henrietta Swan
Leavitt had figured out a way to do so.

347. Probability: 0.9905
Leavitt’s contribution was even more profound.

348. Probability: 0.9984
Leavitt’s genius was to realize that by comparing the
relative magnitudes of Cepheids at different points in the sky you could work out where they
were in relation to each other.

349. Probability: 0.9664
The method provided only relative distances, not absolute distances,
but even so it was the first time that anyone had come up with a usable way to measure the
large-scale universe.

350. Probability: 0.9617
In 1923 he showed that a puff
of distant gossamer in the Andromeda constellation known as M31 wasn’t a gas cloud at all
but a blaze of stars, a galaxy in its own right, a hundred thousand light-years across and at
least nine hundred thousand light-years away.

351. Probability: 0.9609
In 1924 he produced a landmark paper, “Cepheids in Spiral
Nebulae” (nebulae,from the Latin for “clouds,” was his word for galaxies), showing that the
universe consisted not just of the Milky Way but of lots of independent galaxies—“island
universes”—many of them bigger than the Milky Way and much more distant.

352. Probability: 0.9873
This finding alone would have ensured Hubble’s reputation, but he now turned to the
question of working out just how much vaster the universe was, and made an even more
striking discovery.

353. Probability: 0.9946
Using Mount Wilson’s new hundred-inch Hooker telescope
and some clever inferences, he worked out that all the galaxies in the sky (except for our own
local cluster) are moving away from us.

Moreover, their speed and distance were neatly
proportional: the further away the galaxy, the faster it was moving.

This was truly startling.

“We might as well attempt to introduce a new planet into the solar
system or annihilate one already in existence, as to create or destroy a particle of hydrogen,”

He knew, for instance, that hydrogen was the lightest
element, so he gave it an atomic weight of one.

He believed also that water consisted of seven

This was more than a little ironic since it was he, in his

sometimes behave like particles and sometimes like waves—the notion at the very heart of the
new physics.

He turned to meteorites.

414. Probability: 0.9541
The assumption he made—rather a large one, but correct as it turned out—was that many

In the 1960s, in an attempt to bring just a little simplicity to matters, the Caltech physicist
Murray Gell-Mann invented a new class of particles, essentially, in the words of Steven
Weinberg, “to restore some economy to the multitude of hadrons”—a collective term used by
physicists for protons, neutrons, and other particles governed by the strong nuclear force.

432. Probability: 0.9847
Gell-Mann took the name from a line in Finnegans Wake: “Three quarks for Muster

latter is almost certainly the pronunciation Joyce had in mind.) The fundamental simplicity of
quarks was not long lived.

As Donald Goldsmith notes, when astronomers say that the galaxy M87

Improbably enough, the one thing that resolves all this is
Einstein’s cosmological constant—the little piece of math he dropped into the general theory

Wegener developed the theory that the world’s continents had once come together in a
single landmass he called Pangaea, where flora and fauna had been able to mingle, before the
continents had split apart and floated off to their present positions.

453. Probability: 0.9823
This suggested that as the molten
Earth had cooled, it had become wrinkled in the manner of a baked apple, creating ocean
basins and mountain ranges.

454. Probability: 0.9683
Clearly the time was ripe for a new
theory.

He was a

To get around the problems of fossil distributions, they posited ancient “land
bridges” wherever they were needed.

457. Probability: 0.9834
When it was realized that ancient tapirs had existed simultaneously in South
America and Southeast Asia a land bridge was drawn there, too.

458. Probability: 0.9665
These
connective tendrils had not only conveniently appeared whenever it was necessary to move a
living organism from one landmass to another, but then obligingly vanished without leaving a

It was Arthur Holmes, the English geologist who did so much to determine the age of the
Earth, who suggested a possible way.

460. Probability: 0.9970
Scientists dealt with this paradox in the handiest possible way.

461. Probability: 0.9854
Aboard this vessel was a fancy
new depth sounder called a fathometer, which was designed to facilitate inshore maneuvers
during beach landings, but Hess realized that it could equally well be used for scientific
purposes and never switched it off, even when far out at sea, even in the heat of battle.

462. Probability: 0.9881
What
he found was entirely unexpected.

463. Probability: 0.9824
In so doing, they found an even bigger surprise: the mightiest and most
extensive mountain range on Earth was—mostly—underwater.

464. Probability: 0.9718
If you began at Iceland, you
could follow it down the center of the Atlantic Ocean, around the bottom of Africa, and across
the Indian and Southern Oceans, below Australia; there it angled across the Pacific as if
making for Baja California before shooting up the west coast of the United States to Alaska.

465. Probability: 0.9787
People laying ocean-floor cables in the
nineteenth century had realized that there was some kind of mountainous intrusion in the mid-
Atlantic from the way the cables ran, but the continuous nature and overall scale of the chain
was a stunning surprise.

466. Probability: 0.9772
Moreover, it contained physical anomalies that couldn’t be explained.

467. Probability: 0.9842
This seemed to suggest that the Earth was splitting apart at
the seams, like a nut bursting out of its shell.

468. Probability: 0.9726
It was an absurd and unnerving notion, but the
evidence couldn’t be denied.

469. Probability: 0.9818
It also explained why ocean floors
everywhere were so comparatively youthful.

470. Probability: 0.9637
Now Hess could see why.

471. Probability: 0.9934
It was a beautiful theory that explained a great deal.

472. Probability: 0.9917
Meanwhile, two researchers, working independently, were making some startling findings
by drawing on a curious fact of Earth history that had been discovered several decades earlier.

473. Probability: 0.9519
In effect they “remember” where the

It finally fell to two men from Cambridge University, a geophysicist named Drummond
Matthews and a graduate student of his named Fred Vine, to draw all the strands together.

476. Probability: 0.9898
It roughly traces the outline of the continent’s western coast (which is why that
area is so seismically active, because of the bump and crush of the plate boundary), but
ignores the eastern seaboard altogether and instead extends halfway across the Atlantic to the
mid-ocean ridge.

477. Probability: 0.9638

Mysteriously and over millions of years, it appears that

In 1912, a man drilling a well for the town water supply reported bringing up a
lot of strangely deformed rock—“crystalline clast breccia with a melt matrix” and “overturned
ejecta flap,” as it was later described in an official report.

481. Probability: 0.9881
The water was odd too.

482. Probability: 0.9652
Nothing permanent is on display, and
nowhere in the town is there any historical marker.

483. Probability: 0.9958
Every June now Manson has a weeklong event
called Crater Days, which was dreamed up as a way of helping people forget that unhappy
anniversary.

484. Probability: 0.9536
But for one brief period in the 1980s, Manson was the most geologically
exciting place on Earth.

485. Probability: 0.9695
Barringer believed
that the crater had been formed by a ten-million-ton meteor, heavily freighted with iron and
nickel, and it was his confident expectation that he would make a fortune digging it out.

486. Probability: 0.9956
(For reasons I cannot supply,
Gilbert conducted these experiments not in a laboratory at Columbia but in a hotel room.)
Somehow from this Gilbert concluded that the Moon’s craters were indeed formed by
impacts—in itself quite a radical notion for the time—but that the Earth’s were not.

487. Probability: 0.9979
It took some inspired deductions by the
astronomer William Herschel to work out that they were nowhere near planet sized but much
smaller.

488. Probability: 0.9722
Put them adrift in space and what they might do is beyond guessing.

489. Probability: 0.9748
The arresting analogy that is always made is that the number of people in the world

Both conveniently mean “chalk,” which

491. Probability: 0.9589
It occurred to him
that the answer might lie in dust from space.

492. Probability: 0.9527
Scattered through this thin dusting
are exotic elements not normally much found on Earth.

493. Probability: 0.9798
Previously Asaro had used the
technique to analyze pieces of pottery, but Alvarez reasoned that if they measured the amount
of one of the exotic elements in his son’s soil samples and compared that with its annual rate
of deposition, they would know how long it had taken the samples to form.

494. Probability: 0.9839
“Well, they were very charming, very persuasive,” Asaro recalled in an interview in 2002.

495. Probability: 0.9941
“And it seemed an interesting challenge, so I agreed to try.

496. Probability: 0.9586
The amount of iridium in the Alvarez sample was more than three hundred times
normal levels—far beyond anything they might have predicted.

497. Probability: 0.9687
Clearly something big and abrupt, and probably
cataclysmic, had produced this arresting spike.

498. Probability: 0.9504
McLaren, proposed at the group’s annual conference the
possibility that an extraterrestrial impact may have been the cause of an earlier event known
as the Frasnian extinction.

499. Probability: 0.9710
But it did.

500. Probability: 0.9780
And now here we were telling paleontologists that we had solved a problem that had
eluded them for over a century.

501. Probability: 0.9897
Opponents of the Alvarez theory produced any number of alternative explanations for the
iridium deposits—for instance, that they were generated by prolonged volcanic eruptions in
India called the Deccan Traps—and above all insisted that there was no proof that the
dinosaurs disappeared abruptly from the fossil record at the iridium boundary.

502. Probability: 0.9858
He insisted that the
iridium had been deposited by volcanic action even while conceding in a newspaper interview
that he had no actual evidence of it.

On a dirt track in the Tanami Desert—normally one of
the emptiest places on Earth—they came over a slight rise just as another vehicle was
approaching.

511. Probability: 0.9570
This was actually used as evidence to support the notion that the extinction of dinosaurs was
swift and emphatic—and so it was in geological terms.

512. Probability: 0.9876
It would certainly be the most interesting few months in the history of the world.

Today, the site of Voorhies’s discovery is called Ashfall Fossil Beds State Park, and it has a
stylish new visitors’ center and museum, with thoughtful displays on the geology of Nebraska
and the history of the fossil beds.

The center incorporates a lab with a glass wall through
which visitors can watch paleontologists cleaning bones.

It is fairly remarkable to

522. Probability: 0.9537
Oldham, while examining some seismograph readings from an
earthquake in Guatemala, noticed that certain shock waves had penetrated to a point deep
within the Earth and then bounced off at an angle, as if they had encountered some kind of
barrier.

523. Probability: 0.9989
The scale is of course more an
idea than an object, an arbitrary measure of the Earth’s tremblings based on surface
measurements.

524. Probability: 0.9902
These

525. Probability: 0.9954
Specifically, they got the
idea to drill through the ocean floor (the continental crust was too thick) to the Moho
discontinuity and to extract a piece of the Earth’s mantle for examination at leisure.

526. Probability: 0.9720
The
thinking was that if they could understand the nature of the rocks inside the Earth, they might
begin to understand how they interacted, and thus possibly be able to predict earthquakes and
other unwelcome events.

The

Four years later, Soviet scientists decided to try their luck on dry land.

529. Probability: 0.9562
They chose a spot on
Russia’s Kola Peninsula, near the Finnish border, and set to work with the hope of drilling to
a depth of fifteen kilometers.

530. Probability: 0.9800
The work proved harder than expected, but the Soviets were
commendably persistent.

531. Probability: 0.9927
Interestingly, even though the hole was modest, nearly everything about it was surprising.

532. Probability: 0.9793
Most surprising of all was that the rock
at that depth was saturated with water—something that had not been thought possible.

533. Probability: 0.9503
What happens is that
deep in the Earth there is an explosion that fires, in effect, a cannonball of magma to the

Sixty years later an English vicar named Osmond Fisher presciently

but that idea took a very long time to gain support.

By coincidence just at this time NASA decided to test some new high-altitude cameras by
taking photographs of Yellowstone, copies of which some thoughtful official passed on to the
park authorities on the assumption that they might make a nice blow-up for one of the
visitors’ centers.

544. Probability: 0.9680
But if you imagine
the volume of ejected material from Krakatau as being about the size of a golf ball, then the

behind.

Howard divided clouds into three groups: stratus for the layered clouds, cumulus for the
fluffy ones (the word means “heaped” in Latin), and cirrus (meaning “curled”) for the high,
thin feathery formations that generally presage colder weather.

614. Probability: 0.9857
To these he subsequently
added a fourth term, nimbus (from the Latin for “cloud”), for a rain cloud.

615. Probability: 0.9849
The beauty of
Howard’s system was that the basic components could be freely recombined to describe every
shape and size of passing cloud—stratocumulus, cirrostratus, cumulocongestus, and so on.

616. Probability: 0.9955
It
was an immediate hit, and not just in England.

617. Probability: 0.9709
The poet Johann von Goethe in Germany was
so taken with the system that he dedicated four poems to Howard.

By locking the carbon up in their shells, they keep it from
being reevaporated into the atmosphere, where it would build up dangerously as a greenhouse
gas.

621. Probability: 0.9619
It is remarkable, when you behold an
extraordinary natural feature like the White Cliffs of Dover in England, to reflect that it is
made up of nothing but tiny deceased marine organisms, but even more remarkable when you
realize how much carbon they cumulatively sequester.

622. Probability: 0.9868
The good news is that even
here nature is quite wonderful.

623. Probability: 0.9827
Water is strange stuff.

624. Probability: 0.9968
Once it is within whispering distance of freezing, it begins—perversely, beguilingly,
extremely improbably—to expand.

625. Probability: 0.9862
Because it expands, ice floats on water—“an utterly bizarre
property,” according to John Gribbin.

626. Probability: 0.9874
If it lacked this splendid waywardness, ice would sink,
and lakes and oceans would freeze from the bottom up.

627. Probability: 0.9672
The hydrogen atoms
cling fiercely to their oxygen host, but also make casual bonds with other water molecules.

628. Probability: 0.9500
The nature of a water molecule means that it engages in a kind of dance with other water
molecules, briefly pairing and then moving on, like the ever-changing partners in a quadrille,
to use Robert Kunzig’s nice phrase.

629. Probability: 0.9833
This creates a sort of membrane strong enough to support insects and
skipping stones.

630. Probability: 0.9558
From every cell, water molecules rush off like
so many volunteer firemen to try to dilute and carry off the sudden intake of salt.

So it came as
something of a surprise when, in 1860, one of the first transatlantic telegraph cables was
hauled up for repairs from more than two miles down, and it was found to be thickly
encrusted with corals, clams, and other living detritus.

Although they were equal partners, the
more colorful Beebe has always received far more written attention.

635. Probability: 0.9932
Tiring of that, he decided to adopt
the life of an adventurer and for the next quarter century traveled extensively through Asia
and South America with a succession of attractive female assistants whose jobs were
inventively described as “historian and technicist” or “assistant in fish problems.” He
supported these endeavors with a succession of popular books with titles like Edge of the
Jungle and Jungle Days, though he also produced some respectable books on wildlife and
ornithology.

636. Probability: 0.9748
In the mid-1920s, on a trip to the Galápagos Islands, he discovered “the delights of
dangling,” as he described deep-sea diving.

637. Probability: 0.9570
Soon afterward he teamed up with Barton, who
came from an even wealthier family, had also attended Columbia, and also longed for
adventure.

638. Probability: 0.9534
Although Beebe nearly always gets the credit, it was in fact Barton who designed
the first bathysphere (from the Greek word for “deep”) and funded the $12,000 cost of its
construction.

639. Probability: 0.9732
He, too, wrote thrilling accounts of their underwater adventures and even starred
in a Hollywood movie called Titans of the Deep, featuring a bathysphere and many exciting
and largely fictionalized encounters with aggressive giant squid and the like.

640. Probability: 0.9700
He even
advertised Camel cigarettes (“They don’t give me jittery nerves”).

One newspaper reviewer of Titans of the Deep
actually thought the star of the film was Beebe.

Broad in The Universe
Below: “No big company like General Dynamics, which made submarines for the Navy,
wanted to take on a project disparaged by both the Bureau of Ships and Admiral Rickover, the
gods of naval patronage.” Eventually, not to say improbably, Alvin was constructed by
General Mills, the food company, at a factory where it made the machines to produce
breakfast cereals.

Maybe much less.”
But oceanographers are nothing if not industrious, and they have made several important
discoveries with their limited resources—including, in 1977, one of the most important and
startling biological discoveries of the twentieth century.

648. Probability: 0.9600
It was a world
independent of sunlight, oxygen, or anything else normally associated with life.

649. Probability: 0.9577
A type of worm called an alvinellid was found living right on the margins, with the water
temperature 140 degrees warmer at its head than at its tail.

Blue whales will sometimes break
off a song, then pick it up again at the same spot six months later.

Sometimes they strike up
with a new song, which no member can have heard before but which each already knows.

For animals that need never surface, obscurity can be even more tantalizing.

Consider the
fabled giant squid.

656. Probability: 0.9765
In the late 1960s a marine biologist named John Isaacs got the idea to
lower a camera with bait attached to it, and found still more, in particular dense swarms of
writhing hagfish, a primitive eel-like creature, as well as darting shoals of grenadier fish.

657. Probability: 0.9587
It is now thought that the larvae of certain organisms may drift through the
water until, by some unknown chemical means, they detect that they have arrived at a food
opportunity and fall onto it.

In no time at all, fishing fleets
were hauling in forty thousand metric tons of roughy a year.

Roughy have adopted this exceedingly unhurried lifestyle because the waters they live
in are so resource-poor.

19 THE RISE OF LIFE
IN 1953, STANLEY Miller, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, took two
flasks—one containing a little water to represent a primeval ocean, the other holding a
mixture of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide gases to represent Earth’s early
atmosphere—connected them with rubber tubes, and introduced some electrical sparks as a
stand-in for lightning.

663. Probability: 0.9743
No one really knows, but there may be as many as a million types of protein in the human
body, and each one is a little miracle.

664. Probability: 0.9961
It makes itself, spontaneously, without
direction, and this is where the unlikelihoods come in.

665. Probability: 0.9565
To grasp what a long shot its existence is, visualize a
standard Las Vegas slot machine but broadened greatly—to about ninety feet, to be precise—
to accommodate 1,055 spinning wheels instead of the usual three or four, and with twenty
symbols on each wheel (one for each common amino acid).1 How long would you have to
pull the handle before all 1,055 symbols came up in the right order?

666. Probability: 0.9579
For random events to produce even a single protein would seem a
stunning improbability—like a whirlwind spinning through a junkyard and leaving behind a
fully assembled jumbo jet, in the colorful simile of the astronomer Fred Hoyle.

667. Probability: 0.9843
And
it goes on from there.

668. Probability: 0.9559
So we
have a paradoxical situation.

If so: wow.

670. Probability: 0.9543
It is only when they come together within the nurturing refuge of a cell that these diverse
materials can take part in the amazing dance that we call life.

671. Probability: 0.9754
As the physicist Paul Davies puts it, “If everything needs everything else, how did the
community of molecules ever arise in the first place?” It is rather as if all the ingredients in
your kitchen somehow got together and baked themselves into a cake—but a cake that could
moreover divide when necessary to produce more cakes.

672. Probability: 0.9907
It is little wonder that we call it the
miracle of life.

673. Probability: 0.9805
So what accounts for all this wondrous complexity?

674. Probability: 0.9873
Take those amazingly improbable
proteins.

675. Probability: 0.9643
The wonder we see in their assembly comes in assuming that they arrived on the
scene fully formed.

676. Probability: 0.9783
But what if the protein chains didn’t assemble all at once?

677. Probability: 0.9866
What if, in the
great slot machine of creation, some of the wheels could be held, as a gambler might hold a
number of promising cherries?

678. Probability: 0.9766
What if, in other words, proteins didn’t suddenly burst into
being, but evolved .

679. Probability: 0.9757
Imagine if you took all the components that make up a human being—carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and so on—and put them in a container with some water, gave it a vigorous stir, and
out stepped a completed person.

680. Probability: 0.9916
That would be amazing.

681. Probability: 0.9850
Perhaps two or three amino acids linked up
for some simple purpose and then after a time bumped into some other similar small cluster
and in so doing “discovered” some additional improvement.

682. Probability: 0.9714
Crystals can do a
number of lifelike things—replicate, respond to environmental stimuli, take on a patterned
complexity.

683. Probability: 0.9688
The meteorite was of a rare type known as a
carbonaceous chondrite, and the townspeople helpfully collected and brought in some two
hundred pounds of it.

684. Probability: 0.9937
The timing could hardly have been better.

685. Probability: 0.9967
But this ancestral packet did something additional and extraordinary: it cleaved
itself and produced an heir.

686. Probability: 0.9891
It was the moment of creation for us all.

687. Probability: 0.9650
Biologists sometimes call it the Big Birth.

688. Probability: 0.9933
In a very real sense, it is its own.

This is largely thanks to the ingenuity of a man named Bill Compston, who is
now retired but in the 1970s built the world’s first Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro
Probe—or SHRIMP, as it is more affectionately known from its initial letters.

690. Probability: 0.9848
The prototype SHRIMP was built
and machined in the Earth Science department’s own workshops, and looked like something
that had been built from spare parts on a budget, but it worked great.

691. Probability: 0.9915
Ask a pair of
geochemists how something like this works, and they will start talking about isotopic
abundances and ionization levels with an enthusiasm that is more endearing than fathomable.

692. Probability: 0.9590
The upshot of it, however, was that the machine, by bombarding a sample of rock with
streams of charged atoms, is able to detect subtle differences in the amounts of lead and
uranium in the zircon samples, by which means the age of rocks can be accurately adduced.

693. Probability: 0.9973
The Earth Sciences compound was an odd combination of things—part offices, part labs,
part machine shed.

694. Probability: 0.9816
Back in Bennett’s office after our tour, I noticed hanging on her wall a poster giving an
artist’s colorfully imaginative interpretation of Earth as it might have looked 3.5 billion years
ago, just when life was getting going, in the ancient period known to earth science as the
Archaean.

695. Probability: 0.9906
The poster showed an alien landscape of huge, very active volcanoes, and a
steamy, copper-colored sea beneath a harsh red sky.

696. Probability: 0.9730
And yet right there”—she tapped the stromatolites—“you
have organisms almost at the surface.

697. Probability: 0.9839
In short, it was Earth, but an
Earth we wouldn’t recognize as our own.

698. Probability: 0.9857
At some point in the first billion years of life, cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae,
learned to tap into a freely available resource—the hydrogen that exists in spectacular
abundance in water.

699. Probability: 0.9920
They absorbed water molecules, supped on the hydrogen, and released
the oxygen as waste, and in so doing invented photosynthesis.

700. Probability: 0.9795
The new oxygen-using organisms had two advantages.

701. Probability: 0.9777
2
The cyanobacteria were a runaway success.

702. Probability: 0.9699
As they went through their chemical
routines, the cyanobacteria became very slightly tacky, and that tackiness trapped
microparticles of dust and sand, which became bound together to form slightly weird but solid
structures—the stromatolites that were featured in the shallows of the poster on Victoria
Bennett’s office wall.

703. Probability: 0.9947
Sometimes they looked
like enormous cauliflowers, sometimes like fluffy mattresses (stromatolite comes from the
Greek for “mattress”), sometimes they came in the form of columns, rising tens of meters
above the surface of the water—sometimes as high as a hundred meters.

704. Probability: 0.9795
In all their
manifestations, they were a kind of living rock, and they represented the world’s first
cooperative venture, with some varieties of primitive organism living just at the surface and
others living just underneath, each taking advantage of conditions created by the other.

705. Probability: 0.9590
This was most unexpected—so unexpected,
in fact, that it was some years before scientists realized quite what they had found.

706. Probability: 0.9690
Today,
however, Shark Bay is a tourist attraction—or at least as much of a tourist attraction as a place
hundreds of miles from anywhere much and dozens of miles from anywhere at all can ever be.

But it is a
curiously giddying moment to find yourself staring at living remnants of Earth as it was 3.5
billion years ago.

708. Probability: 0.9908
But once the stage was set, and apparently quite suddenly, an
entirely new type of cell arose—one with a nucleus and other little bodies collectively called
organelles (from a Greek word meaning “little tools”).

The captive bacterium became, it
is thought, a mitochondrion.

Without
this niftily facilitating trick, life on Earth today would be nothing more than a sludge of
simple microbes.

711. Probability: 0.9692
They look like bacteria, divide like
bacteria, and sometimes respond to antibiotics in the way bacteria do.

712. Probability: 0.9947
Compared with the
bacteria that had gone before, these new protists were wonders of design and sophistication.

713. Probability: 0.9890
Eventually the eukaryotes learned an even more singular trick.

714. Probability: 0.9845
It took a long time—a
billion years or so—but it was a good one when they mastered it.

They learned to form
together into complex multicellular beings.

Thanks to this innovation, big, complicated,

It is a prodigious and gratifying feat.

And they are amazingly prolific.

720. Probability: 0.9602
With this ability to evolve rapidly goes another, even scarier advantage.

It’s
rather as if a human could go to an insect to get the necessary genetic coding to sprout wings
or walk on ceilings.

Instead they grow directly on their food source,
which can be almost anything.

727. Probability: 0.9853
But when conditions grow tough, they crawl to a
central gathering place and become, almost miraculously, a slug.

728. Probability: 0.9880
The slug is not a thing of
beauty and it doesn’t go terribly far—usually just from the bottom of a pile of leaf litter to the
top, where it is in a slightly more exposed position—but for millions of years this may well
have been the niftiest trick in the universe.

And it doesn’t stop there.

Having hauled itself up to a more favorable locale, the slime
mold transforms itself yet again, taking on the form of a plant.

By some curious orderly
process the cells reconfigure, like the members of a tiny marching band, to make a stalk atop
of which forms a bulb known as a fruiting body.

Inside the fruiting body are millions of
spores that, at the appropriate moment, are released to the wind to blow away and become
single-celled organisms that can start the process again.

733. Probability: 0.9810
When genetic testing
arrived, people in lab coats were surprised to find that slime molds were so distinctive and
peculiar that they weren’t directly related to anything else in nature, and sometimes not even
to each other.

Whittaker unveiled in the journalScience a
proposal to divide life into five principal branches—kingdoms, as they are known—called
Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, and Monera.

735. Probability: 0.9788
Some taxonomists reserved it for large unicellular organisms—the eukaryotes—but others
treated it as the kind of odd sock drawer of biology, putting into it anything that didn’t fit
anywhere else.

736. Probability: 0.9828
It included (depending on which text you consulted) slime molds, amoebas,
and even seaweed, among much else.

737. Probability: 0.9751
Ironically, just as Whittaker’s five-kingdom classification was beginning to find its way
into textbooks, a retiring academic at the University of Illinois was groping his way toward a
discovery that would challenge everything.

For the sake of “the principle of
balance,” Mayr argues for combining the simple bacterial organisms in a single category,
Prokaryota, while placing the more complex and “highly evolved” remainder in the empire
Eukaryota, which would stand alongside as an equal.

about them was their sudden appearance.

759. Probability: 0.9552
Even now, as Fortey says, it can be startling to go to
the right formation of rocks and to work your way upward through the eons finding no visible
life at all, and then suddenly “a whole Profallotaspis or Elenellus as big as a crab will pop
into your waiting hands.” These were creatures with limbs, gills, nervous systems, probing
antennae, “a brain of sorts,” in Fortey’s words, and the strangest eyes ever seen.

760. Probability: 0.9724
More than this, the earliest trilobites didn’t consist of just one venturesome species
but dozens, and didn’t appear in one or two locations but all over.

feet to near the mountain’s summit.

766. Probability: 0.9916
Gould, ever scrupulous, discovered from reading Walcott’s diaries that the story of the
Burgess Shale’s discovery appears to have been somewhat embroidered—Walcott makes no
mention of a slipping horse or falling snow—but there is no disputing that it was an
extraordinary find.

767. Probability: 0.9567
He was
astonished by what he found.

768. Probability: 0.9526
The fossils were far more varied and magnificent than Walcott
had indicated in his writings.

769. Probability: 0.9759
With his supervisor, Harry Whittington, and fellow graduate student Derek Briggs, Conway
Morris spent the next several years making a systematic revision of the entire collection, and
cranking out one exciting monograph after another as discovery piled upon discovery.

770. Probability: 0.9789
Many
of the creatures employed body plans that were not simply unlike anything seen before or
since, but were bizarrely different.

771. Probability: 0.9867
One, Opabinia, had five eyes and a nozzle-like snout with
claws on the end.

772. Probability: 0.9868
A third had evidently tottered about on rows of stilt-like legs, and was so odd
that they named it Hallucigenia.

773. Probability: 0.9928
The idea
was to see if there were any old mines that might be profitably reworked using newer
technologies, so he wasn’t studying surface rocks at all, still less fossils.

774. Probability: 0.9636
But one day while
eating his lunch, Sprigg idly overturned a hunk of sandstone and was surprised—to put it
mildly—to see that the rock’s surface was covered in delicate fossils, rather like the
impressions leaves make in mud.

775. Probability: 0.9815
Then he quit his government job and
took up oil exploration.

776. Probability: 0.9519
Young Mason got his picture in the
papers and was treated as a precocious hero; he still is in many books.

777. Probability: 0.9749
It was the fertile time when all the great ‘fundamental body plans’ were invented.

778. Probability: 0.9533
Back in the Cambrian, new phyla and
new classes arose.

779. Probability: 0.9893
Hallucigenia, it turned out, had been reconstructed upside down.

780. Probability: 0.9894
Its stilt-like legs were
actually spikes along its back.

781. Probability: 0.9798
This made them, as Fortey
has written, “no less interesting, or odd, just more explicable.” Their weird body plans were
just a kind of youthful exuberance—the evolutionary equivalent, as it were, of spiked hair and
tongue studs.

782. Probability: 0.9573
It is one thing to have one well-formed creature like a trilobite burst forth in isolation—that
really is a wonder—but to have many of them, all distinct but clearly related, turning up
simultaneously in the fossil record in places as far apart as China and New York clearly
suggests that we are missing a big part of their history.

783. Probability: 0.9859
“And it could have happened quite
swiftly, so in that sense I suppose it was an explosion.” The idea is that just as mammals
bided their time for a hundred million years until the dinosaurs cleared off and then seemingly
burst forth in profusion all over the planet, so too perhaps the arthropods and other triploblasts
waited in semimicroscopic anonymity for the dominant Ediacaran organisms to have their
day.

784. Probability: 0.9596
One of the
main early genera, Spriggina, was named in his honor, as were several species, and the whole
became known as the Ediacaran fauna after the hills through which he had searched.

785. Probability: 0.9744
It couldn’t wait to get going, but then, having gotten
going, it seemed in very little hurry to move on.

786. Probability: 0.9567
Consider the lichen.

787. Probability: 0.9673
Because lichens grew on bare
rock without evident nourishment or the production of seeds, many people—educated
people—believed they were stones caught in the process of becoming plants.

788. Probability: 0.9895
“Spontaneously,
inorganic stone becomes living plant!” rejoiced one observer, a Dr.

789. Probability: 0.9786
They are in fact
a partnership between fungi and algae.

790. Probability: 0.9710
Then, finally, the first sea plants appear, followed twenty minutes
later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaran fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in
Australia.

791. Probability: 0.9659
So anytime life does something bold it is quite an event, and few occasions were more
eventful than when life moved on to the next stage in our narrative and came out of the sea.

792. Probability: 0.9562
To survive out of water, marine
creatures needed to come up with new load-bearing internal architecture—not the sort of
adjustment that happens overnight.

793. Probability: 0.9771
Never
would there be a more propitious time to find an alternative environment to water.

794. Probability: 0.9777
This allowed animals to grow remarkably
large remarkably quickly.

795. Probability: 0.9989
The answer lies in a slightly obscure but ingenious field
known as isotope geochemistry.

796. Probability: 0.9627
By comparing these ancient ratios, the
geochemists can cunningly read conditions in the ancient world—oxygen levels, air and ocean
temperatures, the extent and timing of ice ages, and much else.

797. Probability: 0.9871
By combining their isotope
findings with other fossil residues—pollen levels and so on—scientists can, with considerable
confidence, re-create entire landscapes that no human eye ever saw.

798. Probability: 0.9878
Instead of completely rotting down, falling fronds and other dead vegetative matter
accumulated in rich, wet sediments, which were eventually squeezed into the vast coal beds
that sustain much economic activity even now.

799. Probability: 0.9784
The heady levels of oxygen clearly encouraged outsized growth.

800. Probability: 0.9832
With such creatures on the prowl, it is perhaps not surprising that insects in the period
evolved a trick that could keep them safely out of tongue shot: they learned to fly.

801. Probability: 0.9658
Some took
to this new means of locomotion with such uncanny facility that they haven’t changed their
techniques in all the time since.

802. Probability: 0.9516
Trees and other vegetation likewise
attained outsized proportions.

803. Probability: 0.9528
Luckily
the team found just such a creature, a three-foot-long animal called an Ichthyostega.

804. Probability: 0.9530
Anapsids gave rise to the turtles, which for a time, perhaps a
touch improbably, appeared poised to predominate as the planet’s most advanced and deadly
species, before an evolutionary lurch let them settle for durability rather than dominance.

805. Probability: 0.9680
These formed Megadynasty 2.

806. Probability: 0.9798
The fall of
the Ediacaran fauna was followed by the creative outburst of the Cambrian period.

807. Probability: 0.9866
The
Ordovician extinction of 440 million years ago cleared the oceans of a lot of immobile filter
feeders and, somehow, created conditions that favored darting fish and giant aquatic reptiles.

808. Probability: 0.9598
These in turn were in an ideal position to send colonists onto dry land when another blowout
in the late Devonian period gave life another sound shaking.

809. Probability: 0.9573
Imagine a human history without horses, without grazing animals.

810. Probability: 0.9973
This last is a particularly intriguing possibility.

811. Probability: 0.9540
The light show would be a glorious one, but it would almost
certainly kill a very high proportion of all that basked in its glow.

812. Probability: 0.9607
As we have seen from the Manson impact,
you can receive a ferocious blow and still stage a full, if presumably somewhat wobbly,
recovery.

813. Probability: 0.9770
The KT meteor had the additional advantage—advantage if you are a mammal, that is—
that it landed in a shallow sea just ten meters deep, probably at just the right angle, at a time
when oxygen levels were 10 percent higher than at present and so the world was more
combustible.

814. Probability: 0.9725
Some animals absolutely prospered—including, a little surprisingly, the turtles once again.

815. Probability: 0.9781
As Flannery notes, the period immediately after the dinosaur extinction could well be known
as the Age of Turtles.

816. Probability: 0.9834
Water obviously offered
protection against heat and flame, but also presumably provided more sustenance in the lean
period that followed.

817. Probability: 0.9798
Instead,
mammals found themselves in a world to which they were as well suited as anything alive.

818. Probability: 0.9838
But once they got going, mammals expanded prodigiously—sometimes to an almost
preposterous degree.

819. Probability: 0.9931
Early members of the raccoon family migrated to South America,
discovered a vacancy, and evolved into creatures the size and ferocity of bears.

820. Probability: 0.9713
The entrance hall of the American Museum of Natural History
in New York is dominated by an even grander tableau: a skeleton of a large Barosaurus
defending her baby from attack by a darting and toothy Allosaurus.

821. Probability: 0.9562
In the late 1980s a paleontologist from the Milwaukee Public Museum, Peter Sheehan,
decided to conduct an experiment.

822. Probability: 0.9956
And
often, as we shall see, it goes on in ways that are decidedly amazing.

23 THE RICHNESS OF BEING
HERE AND THERE in the Natural History Museum in London, built into recesses along the
underlit corridors or standing between glass cases of minerals and ostrich eggs and a century
or so of other productive clutter, are secret doors—at least secret in the sense that there is
nothing about them to attract the visitor’s notice.

824. Probability: 0.9860
It is a little like wandering through Darwin’s brain.

825. Probability: 0.9591
It also explained his habit of wearing a large overcoat even during
warm weather.

“It’s remarkable, isn’t it?” Fortey agreed.

828. Probability: 0.9782
“That used to be Botany back there.” He punched
a button for another floor, and we found our way at length to Botany by means of back
staircases and discreet trespass through yet more departments where investigators toiled
lovingly over once-living objects.

829. Probability: 0.9834
When Emerson poetically noted that mosses favor the north sides of trees (“The moss upon
the forest bark, was pole-star when the night was dark”) he really meant lichens, for in the
nineteenth century mosses and lichens weren’t distinguished.

830. Probability: 0.9950
They are, however, prolific.

831. Probability: 0.9535
But it is thanks
to such efforts that Len Ellis’s collection is one of the world’s most comprehensive.

832. Probability: 0.9702
All the specimens are kept in lustrous old mahogany cabinets so
strikingly fine that I remarked upon them.

833. Probability: 0.9824
“Oh, those were Sir Joseph Banks’s, from his house in Soho Square,” Ellis said casually, as
if identifying a recent purchase from Ikea.

834. Probability: 0.9721
“He had them built to hold his specimens from the
Endeavour voyage.” He regarded the cabinets thoughtfully, as if for the first time in a long
while.

835. Probability: 0.9976
This was an amazing disclosure.

836. Probability: 0.9687
Goodness knows what the bluff Captain Cook
made of such a velvety and pampered assemblage, but he seems to have liked Banks well
enough and could not but admire his talents in botany—a feeling shared by posterity.

837. Probability: 0.9778
Never before or since has a botanical party enjoyed greater triumphs.

838. Probability: 0.9906
Partly it was because
the voyage took in so many new or little-known places—Tierra del Fuego, Tahiti, New
Zealand, Australia, New Guinea—but mostly it was because Banks was such an astute and
inventive collector.

839. Probability: 0.9893
Even when unable to go ashore at Rio de Janeiro because of a quarantine,
he sifted through a bale of fodder sent for the ship’s livestock and made new discoveries.

Thomas Nuttall, the man who named the wisteria after Caspar Wistar, came to
America as an uneducated printer but discovered a passion for plants and walked halfway
across the country and back again, collecting hundreds of growing things never seen before.

841. Probability: 0.9600
John Fraser, for whom is named the Fraser fir, spent years in the wilderness collecting on
behalf of Catherine the Great and emerged at length to find that Russia had a new czar who
thought he was mad and refused to honor his contract.

842. Probability: 0.9892
Fraser took everything to Chelsea,
where he opened a nursery and made a handsome living selling rhododendrons, azaleas,
magnolias, Virginia creepers, asters, and other colonial exotica to a delighted English gentry.

843. Probability: 0.9908
There was also all the fauna of the new worlds—kangaroos, kiwis,
raccoons, bobcats, mosquitoes, and other curious forms beyond imagining.

844. Probability: 0.9920
In the early 1730s, still in
his twenties, he began to produce catalogues of the world’s plant and animal species, using a
system of his own devising, and gradually his fame grew.

Rarely has a man been more comfortable with his own greatness.

To the parts of one species of clam he gave the names vulva, labia,
pubes, anus, and hymen.

He grouped plants by the nature of their reproductive organs and
endowed them with an arrestingly anthropomorphic amorousness.

848. Probability: 0.9957
The flowers’
leaves serve as a bridal bed, which the Creator has so gloriously arranged, adorned
with such noble bed curtains, and perfumed with so many soft scents that the
bridegroom with his bride might there celebrate their nuptials with so much the
greater solemnity.

849. Probability: 0.9972
But his system of classification was irresistible.

850. Probability: 0.9890
It required an instinct—a genius, in fact—
for spotting the salient qualities of a species.

851. Probability: 0.9509
Animals might be
categorized by whether they were wild or domesticated, terrestrial or aquatic, large or small,
even whether they were thought handsome and noble or of no consequence.

He made room for mythical beasts and “monstrous humans”
whose descriptions he gullibly accepted from seamen and other imaginative travelers.

853. Probability: 0.9825
Among other accomplishments, he saw that whales belonged with cows,
mice, and other common terrestrial animals in the order Quadrupedia (later changed to
Mammalia), which no one had done before.

Wilson in The Diversity of Life puts the number at a

More
extraordinary still, according to a report in the Economist, as much as 97 percent of the
world’s plant and animal species may still await discovery.

857. Probability: 0.9556
In The
Diversity of Life, he estimated the number of known species of all types—plants, insects,
microbes, algae, everything—at 1.4 million, but added that that was just a guess.

In a well-known exercise in the 1980s, Terry Erwin of the Smithsonian
Institution saturated a stand of nineteen rain forest trees in Panama with an insecticide fog,
then collected everything that fell into his nets from the canopy.

859. Probability: 0.9726
Among his haul (actually
hauls, since he repeated the experiment seasonally to make sure he caught migrant species)
were 1,200 types of beetle.

860. Probability: 0.9905
In an attempt to haul things into the modern age, in 2001 Kevin Kelly, cofounder of Wired
magazine, launched an enterprise called the All Species Foundation with the aim of finding
every living organism and recording it on a database.

861. Probability: 0.9819
They then traveled to a coastal location a few miles away,
scooped up another gram of earth, and found that it contained 4,000 to 5,000 other species.

It’s just that no one had looked there before.

863. Probability: 0.9616
Koen
Maes of the Kenyan National Museum told me that he went to one cloud forest, as
mountaintop forests are known in Kenya, and in a half hour “of not particularly dedicated
looking” found four new species of millipedes, three representing new genera, and one new
species of tree.

864. Probability: 0.9860
“Big tree,” he added, and shaped his arms as if about to dance with a very

Because they can’t flee from predators, plants have had

Hooke
achieved many things in his sixty-eight years—he was both an accomplished theoretician and
a dab hand at making ingenious and useful instruments—but nothing he did brought him
greater admiration than his popular book Microphagia: or Some Physiological Descriptions of
Miniature Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses, produced in 1665.

874. Probability: 0.9889
It revealed to an enchanted

The draper’s name was
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek.

876. Probability: 0.9528
To this day it is not known how he got such magnificent magnifications from simple
handheld devices, which were little more than modest wooden dowels with a tiny bubble of
glass embedded in them, far more like magnifying glasses than what most of us think of as
microscopes, but really not much like either.

877. Probability: 0.9533
What
Leeuwenhoek had found were protozoa.

878. Probability: 0.9515
He calculated that there were 8,280,000 of these tiny

FitzRoy, who was very odd, chose Darwin in part because he
liked the shape of Darwin’s nose.

891. Probability: 0.9614

The cause of the illness has never been established, but the most romantic and perhaps

He even referred to
the theory forever after as “Darwinism.” Much less amenable to Darwin’s claim of priority
was a Scottish gardener named Patrick Matthew who had, rather remarkably, also come up
with the principles of natural selection—in fact, in the very year that Darwin had set sail in
theBeagle.

902. Probability: 0.9528
Matthew kicked up in a lively manner, with a letter to Gardener’s Chronicle, when he saw

Department.) Interestingly, each side afterward claimed to have routed the other.

The conclusion was a bold one since nothing in the fossil record supported

Darwin’s theory didn’t really gain widespread acceptance until the 1930s and 1940s, with
the advance of a refined theory called, with a certain hauteur, the Modern Synthesis,
combining Darwin’s ideas with those of Mendel and others.

916. Probability: 0.9590
It is fairly amazing to reflect that at the beginning of the twentieth
century, and for some years beyond, the best scientific minds in the world couldn’t actually
tell you where babies came from.

We are also uncannily alike.

While delving microscopically through the pus in surgical
bandages, Miescher found a substance he didn’t recognize and called it nuclein (because it
resided in the nuclei of cells).

919. Probability: 0.9727
This was an
extraordinary insight, but one so far in advance of the day’s scientific requirements that it
attracted no attention at all.

920. Probability: 0.9930
Clearly there was a need for some inspired and clever experimentation, and happily the age
produced a young person with the diligence and aptitude to undertake it.

921. Probability: 0.9809
His name was
Thomas Hunt Morgan, and in 1904, just four years after the timely rediscovery of Mendel’s
experiments with pea plants and still almost a decade before gene would even become a word,
he began to do remarkably dedicated things with chromosomes.

922. Probability: 0.9763
Morgan was
on the brink of giving up when there occurred a sudden and repeatable mutation—a fly that
had white eyes rather than the usual red ones.

923. Probability: 0.9640
Instead, victory fell
to an unlikely quartet of scientists in England who didn’t work as a team, often weren’t on
speaking terms, and were for the most part novices in the field.

924. Probability: 0.9806
The most unconventional of the foursome was James Watson, an American prodigy who
had distinguished himself as a boy as a member of a highly popular radio program called The
Quiz Kids (and thus could claim to be at least part of the inspiration for some of the members
of the Glass family in Franny and Zooey and other works by J.

She didn’t

However, she did have the best images in existence of the possible structure of DNA,
achieved by means of X-ray crystallography, the technique perfected by Linus Pauling.

926. Probability: 0.9502
Crystallography had been used successfully to map atoms in crystals (hence
“crystallography”), but DNA molecules were a much more finicky proposition.

To
Wilkins’s presumed dismay and embarrassment, in the summer of 1952 she posted a mock

announce the death, on Friday 18th July 1952 of D.N.A.

928. Probability: 0.9742
Crick
and Watson also had the no less convenient good fortune that Pauling’s son was working at
the Cavendish and innocently kept them abreast of any news of developments and setbacks at
home.

929. Probability: 0.9661
By playing with pieces of cardboard cut into the shapes of molecules, Watson
and Crick were able to work out how the pieces fit together.

930. Probability: 0.9814
From this they made a Meccano-
like model—perhaps the most famous in modern science—consisting of metal plates bolted
together in a spiral, and invited Wilkins, Franklin, and the rest of the world to have a look.

931. Probability: 0.9989
It was without
question a brilliant piece of detective work, with or without the boost of Franklin’s picture.

932. Probability: 0.9672
In fact, of course, it was only just beginning.

933. Probability: 0.9869
But combine the genes,
as you would combine piano keys, and you can create chords and melodies of infinite variety.

934. Probability: 0.9632
Put all these genes together, and you have (to continue the metaphor) the great symphony of
existence known as the human genome.

935. Probability: 0.9574
Viewed this way, the chromosomes can be imagined as the book’s
chapters and the genes as individual instructions for making proteins.

936. Probability: 0.9783
Now the particular brilliance of DNA lies in its manner of replication.

937. Probability: 0.9677
It also helps to explain why we are all so similar.

Hox genes answered the long-bewildering question of how
billions of embryonic cells, all arising from a single fertilized egg and carrying identical

By somehow inducing his brother to do much of his work, he was
able to pass many quiet evenings in the university library teaching himself physics,

Earth and their effect on climate.

28 THE MYSTERIOUS BIPED
JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS 1887, a young Dutch doctor with an un-Dutch name, Marie
Eugène François Thomas Dubois, arrived in Sumatra, in the Dutch East Indies, with the
intention of finding the earliest human remains on Earth.1
Several things were extraordinary about this.

988. Probability: 0.9803
To begin with, no one had ever gone looking
for ancient human bones before.

989. Probability: 0.9939
Dubois was driven to the East Indies on nothing stronger than a hunch, the availability of
employment, and the knowledge that Sumatra was full of caves, the environment in which
most of the important hominid fossils had so far been found.

990. Probability: 0.9942
What is most extraordinary in all
this—nearly miraculous, really—is that he found what he was looking for.

991. Probability: 0.9857
The first formal
description of it wasn’t written until 1907, and then by a geologist named William Sollas
“with only a passing competency in anatomy.”
So instead the name and credit for the discovery of the first early humans went to the
Neander Valley in Germany—not unfittingly, as it happens, for by uncanny coincidence
Neander in Greek means “new man.” There in 1856 workmen at another quarry, in a cliff face
overlooking the Düssel River, found some curious-looking bones, which they passed to a
local schoolteacher, knowing he had an interest in all things natural.

992. Probability: 0.9607
To his great credit the
teacher, Johann Karl Fuhlrott, saw that he had some new type of human, though quite what it
was, and how special, would be matters of dispute for some time.

993. Probability: 0.9553
Huxley in
England drily observed how remarkable it was that the soldier, though mortally wounded, had
climbed sixty feet up a cliff, divested himself of his clothing and personal effects, sealed the
cave opening, and buried himself under two feet of soil.

994. Probability: 0.9599
At about the
time that Dubois was setting out for Sumatra, a skeleton found in Périgueux was confidently
declared to be that of an Eskimo.

995. Probability: 0.9914
The next year Dubois’s workers found a virtually complete thighbone that looked
surprisingly modern.

996. Probability: 0.9657
If it is an erectus bone, it is unlike any other found since.

997. Probability: 0.9737
Nonetheless Dubois
used the thighbone to deduce—correctly, as it turned out—that Pithecanthropus walked
upright.

998. Probability: 0.9896
He also produced, with nothing but a scrap of cranium and one tooth, a model of the
complete skull, which also proved uncannily accurate.

999. Probability: 0.9536
In 1895, Dubois returned to Europe, expecting a triumphal reception.

1000. Probability: 0.9841
Hoping to bolster his case, in 1897 Dubois allowed a respected
anatomist from the University of Strasbourg, Gustav Schwalbe, to make a cast of the skullcap.

1001. Probability: 0.9626
Dart could see at once that the Taung skull was not of a
Homo erectus like Dubois’s Java Man, but from an earlier, more apelike creature.

1002. Probability: 0.9687
He placed
its age at two million years and dubbed it Australopithecus africanus, or “southern ape man of
Africa.” In a report to Nature, Dart called the Taung remains “amazingly human” and
suggested the need for an entirely new family, Homo simiadae (“the man-apes”), to
accommodate the find.

1003. Probability: 0.9900
It was
rather as if someone working today were to announce that he had found the ancestral bones of
humans in, say, Missouri.

1004. Probability: 0.9647
Dart’s sole supporter of note was Robert Broom, a Scottish-born physician and
paleontologist of considerable intellect and cherishably eccentric nature.

1005. Probability: 0.9531
It was Broom’s
habit, for instance, to do his fieldwork naked when the weather was warm, which was often.

1006. Probability: 0.9741
When the patients died, which was also often, he would sometimes bury
their bodies in his back garden to dig up for study later.

1007. Probability: 0.9563
For years, the skull—today recognized as one of
the supreme treasures of anthropology—sat as a paperweight on a colleague’s desk.

1008. Probability: 0.9763
First, in China, a gifted Canadian amateur named Davidson Black began to poke around at
a place, Dragon Bone Hill, that was locally famous as a hunting ground for old bones.

1009. Probability: 0.9601
We can only guess how many priceless Homo erectus bones ended up as a
sort of Chinese equivalent of bicarbonate of soda.

1010. Probability: 0.9946
The site had been much denuded by the
time Black arrived, but he found a single fossilized molar and on the basis of that alone quite
brilliantly announced the discovery of Sinanthropus pekinensis, which quickly became known
as Peking Man.

1011. Probability: 0.9946
In the following years as more bones were found and identified there came a flood of new
names—Homo aurignacensis, Australopithecus transvaalensis, Paranthropus crassidens,
Zinjanthropus boisei,and scores of others, nearly all involving a new genus type as well as a
new species.

1012. Probability: 0.9752
Some continue to observe the two hominid genera suggested by Howell in 1960, but others
place some of the australopithecines in a separate genus called Paranthropus , and still others
add an earlier group called Ardipithecus.

1013. Probability: 0.9639
The upshot is that the creatures traditionally called hominids become, under this arrangement, hominins.

1014. Probability: 0.9799
how much you jumbled everything up,” Ian Tattersall, the bearded and friendly curator of
anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, replied when I asked
him the size of the total world archive of hominid and early human bones.

1015. Probability: 0.9946
They appear randomly, often in the most tantalizing fashion.

1016. Probability: 0.9955
“In Europe,” Tattersall offers by way of illustration, “you’ve got hominid skulls in Georgia
dated to about 1.7 million years ago, but then you have a gap of almost a million years before
the next remains turn up in Spain, right on the other side of the continent, and then you’ve got
another 300,000-year gap before you get a Homo heidelbergensis in Germany—and none of
them looks terribly much like any of the others.” He smiled.

1017. Probability: 0.9697
A group of new beings emerged from the tropical forests of Africa and began to move about
on the open savanna.

1018. Probability: 0.9903
She was evidently a good climber, too.

1019. Probability: 0.9722
The BBC television series
Ape Man actually called it “a complete skeleton,” even while showing that it was anything
but.

1020. Probability: 0.9736
It isn’t even actually known that she was a female.

1021. Probability: 0.9867
It depicts life-sized re-creations of a male and a female
walking side by side across the ancient African plain.

1022. Probability: 0.9695
The most striking feature of
the display is that the male holds his left arm protectively around the female’s shoulder.

1023. Probability: 0.9969
It is a
tender and affecting gesture, suggestive of close bonding.

1024. Probability: 0.9947
The tableau is done with such conviction that it is easy to overlook the consideration that
virtually everything above the footprints is imaginary.

1025. Probability: 0.9730
An upright hominid could see better, but could also be seen better.

1026. Probability: 0.9522
It wants glucose instead, and lots of it, even if it means short-
changing other organs.

1027. Probability: 0.9813
Luckily for us, one did—a group of tool users, which seemed to arise from out of nowhere
and overlapped with the shadowy and much disputed Homo habilis.

1028. Probability: 0.9785
To other hominids, Homo
erectus must have seemed terrifyingly powerful, fleet, and gifted.

1029. Probability: 0.9859
It was only because Richard Leakey was on a flight that was diverted
over the valley that he realized it might be more promising than had been thought.

1030. Probability: 0.9800
Such a site was unlikely to yield much, but they dug anyway out of
respect for Kimeu’s instincts and to their astonishment found a nearly complete Homo erectus
skeleton.

1031. Probability: 0.9963
The skeleton had “an entirely modern body structure,” says Tattersall, in a way that
was without precedent.

1032. Probability: 0.9758
Even more surprising was that the amount of growth showed that she had lived weeks or even
months with the disease.

1033. Probability: 0.9976
It was hugely
adventurous and spread across the globe with what seems to have been breathtaking rapidity.

1034. Probability: 0.9866
This has led some hopeful
scientists to suggest that perhaps modern people arose not in Africa at all, but in Asia—which
would be remarkable, not to say miraculous, as no possible precursor species have ever been
found anywhere outside Africa.

1035. Probability: 0.9594
The Asian hominids would have had to appear, as it were,
spontaneously.

1036. Probability: 0.9528
What is certain is that sometime well over a million years ago, some new, comparatively
modern, upright beings left Africa and boldly spread out across much of the globe.

1037. Probability: 0.9694
They
possibly did so quite rapidly, increasing their range by as much as twenty-five miles a year on
average, all while dealing with mountain ranges, rivers, deserts, and other impediments and
adapting to differences in climate and food sources.

1038. Probability: 0.9683
It is a curious irony that the conditions that prompted them to leave Africa would
have made it much more difficult to do so.

1039. Probability: 0.9961
Yet somehow they managed to find their way
around every barrier and to thrive in the lands beyond.

1040. Probability: 0.9694
29 THE RESTLESS APE
SOMETIME ABOUT A million and a half years ago, some forgotten genius of the hominid
world did an unexpected thing.

1041. Probability: 0.9958
He (or very possibly she) took one stone and carefully used it
to shape another.

1042. Probability: 0.9572
The result was a simple teardrop-shaped hand axe, but it was the world’s
first piece of advanced technology.

1043. Probability: 0.9902
It was so superior to existing tools that soon others were following the inventor’s lead and
making hand axes of their own.

1044. Probability: 0.9529
“They made them in the thousands,” says Ian Tattersall.

1045. Probability: 0.9865
It was shaped
like a spearhead, but one the size of a stepping-stone.

1046. Probability: 0.9796
Now here’s the mystery.

1047. Probability: 0.9771
Sometimes they even took unshaped
rocks with them to make into tools later on.

1048. Probability: 0.9772
In the 1940s a Harvard paleontologist named Hallum Movius drew something called the
Movius line, dividing the side with Acheulean tools from the one without.

1049. Probability: 0.9606
To everyone’s astonishment, the bones turned
out to be 23,000 years old.

1050. Probability: 0.9826
This was unexpected to the point of seeming practically impossible.

1051. Probability: 0.9564
Then, something over a hundred thousand years ago, a smarter, lither species of creature—
the ancestors of every one of us alive today—arose on the African plains and began radiating
outward in a second wave.

1052. Probability: 0.9901
“Perhaps we gave them smallpox,” suggests Tattersall.

1053. Probability: 0.9884
We know less about ourselves,
curiously enough, than about almost any other line of hominids.

1054. Probability: 0.9567
In 1947, while doing fieldwork in the Sahara, a Franco-Algerian paleontologist
named Camille Arambourg took refuge from the midday sun under the wing of his light
airplane.

1055. Probability: 0.9536
In
fact, it was the latter.

1056. Probability: 0.9842
It changed utterly how we
viewed Neandertals—but only some of the time, it appears.

1057. Probability: 0.9689
This is more than the difference between
modern Homo sapiens and late Homo erectus , a species we are happy to regard as barely
human.

1058. Probability: 0.9609
They
became them.” He likens the situation to when explorers like Cook or Magellan encountered
remote peoples for the first time.

1059. Probability: 0.9596
Mitochondrial DNA was only discovered
in 1964, but by the 1980s some ingenious souls at the University of California at Berkeley had
realized that it has two features that lend it a particular convenience as a kind of molecular
clock: it is passed on only through the female line, so it doesn’t become scrambled with
paternal DNA with each new generation, and it mutates about twenty times faster than normal
nuclear DNA, making it easier to detect and follow genetic patterns over time.

1060. Probability: 0.9879
One of the most extraordinary points—
almost too extraordinary to credit really—was that the “Africans” used in the study were
actually African-Americans, whose genes had obviously been subjected to considerable
mediation in the past few hundred years.

“After this,” a Penn State academic told the Washington Post,
“people won’t be too concerned about the multiregional theory, which has very little
evidence.”
But all of this overlooked the more or less infinite capacity for surprise offered by the
ancient Mungo people of western New South Wales.

“It turned everything upside down again,” says Thorne with undisguised delight.

1063. Probability: 0.9799
Then other even more curious anomalies began to turn up.

1064. Probability: 0.9628
The only way to account for them is to say that ancestors of
people now living in Asia included archaic hominids—Java Man and the like.

We’ve barely begun.” She refused to be drawn out on what the existence of Asian-origin
genes in Oxfordshire tells us other than that the situation is clearly complicated.

To each

detailed personal history.

“Well, I suppose you must give him some credit for
helping to popularize a difficult subject,” she said and paused thoughtfully.

“Very,” she said.

Drive out of the city on the main highway to
Uganda, and there comes a moment of startling glory when the ground falls away and you are
presented with a hang glider’s view of boundless, pale green African plain.

1071. Probability: 0.9542
Gregory was scouting the area for mineral prospects when he came across a
stretch of open ground littered with anomalous dark stones that had clearly been shaped by
human hand.

1072. Probability: 0.9880
Unexpectedly in the autumn of 2002 I found myself a visitor to this extraordinary site.

1073. Probability: 0.9567
I
was in Kenya for another purpose altogether, visiting some projects run by the charity CARE
International, but my hosts, knowing of my interest in humans for the present volume, had
inserted a visit to Olorgesailie into the schedule.

1074. Probability: 0.9632
“They had to carry the stones from there,” he
said, nodding at a pair of mountains in the hazy middle distance, in opposite directions from
the site: Olorgesailie and Ol Esakut.

1075. Probability: 0.9956
Not
only did they lug hefty stones considerable distances to the lakeside, but, perhaps even more
remarkably, they then organized the site.

1076. Probability: 0.9616
Olorgesailie was, in short, a kind of factory; one that stayed in business for a million years.

1077. Probability: 0.9680
“It’s all a mystery,” Jillani Ngalli told me, beaming happily.

1078. Probability: 0.9736
As a result of this and other departures from common sense, we are not now entirely sure
what a living dodo was like.

1079. Probability: 0.9838
Imagine ground sloths that could look into an upstairs
window, tortoises nearly the size of a small Fiat, monitor lizards twenty feet long basking
beside desert highways in Western Australia.

1080. Probability: 0.9803
Flannery recruited his friend Peter Schouten, an artist and fellow Australian, and together
they embarked on a slightly obsessive quest to scour the world’s major collections to find out
what was lost, what was left, and what had never been known at all.

1081. Probability: 0.9909
Schouten made life-sized paintings of every animal they could
reasonably re-create, and Flannery wrote the words.

1082. Probability: 0.9885
The result was an extraordinary book
called A Gap in Nature, constituting the most complete—and, it must be said, moving—
catalog of animal extinctions from the last three hundred years.

1083. Probability: 0.9710
He even saved a piece of skin, so we had a
good idea of its texture.

1084. Probability: 0.9515
In 1894, when a lighthouse was built on a lonely rock
called Stephens Island, in the tempestuous strait between the North and South Islands of New
Zealand, the lighthouse keeper’s cat kept bringing him strange little birds that it had caught.

1085. Probability: 0.9598
Remarkably, Rothschild’s collecting efforts were neither the most extensive nor the most
generously funded of the nineteenth century.

1086. Probability: 0.9595
That title almost certainly belongs to a slightly
earlier but also very wealthy British collector named Hugh Cuming, who became so
preoccupied with accumulating objects that he built a large oceangoing ship and employed a
crew to sail the world full-time, picking up whatever they could find—birds, plants, animals
of all types, and especially shells.

1087. Probability: 0.9559
Of particular interest to
Rothschild were the islands’ colorful and distinctive birds, often consisting of very small
populations inhabiting extremely specific ranges.

1088. Probability: 0.9628
West Virginia gave out an annual college
scholarship to whoever brought in the most dead pests—and “pests” was liberally interpreted
to mean almost anything that wasn’t grown on farms or kept as pets.

1089. Probability: 0.9926
Then in 1939, by happy coincidence two separate birding enthusiasts, in widely separated
locations, came across lone survivors just two days apart.

1090. Probability: 0.9645
To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an
achievement.

1091. Probability: 0.9861
It is a talent we have only barely begun to grasp.

1092. Probability: 0.9773
We have arrived at this position of eminence in a stunningly short time.

1093. Probability: 0.9906
This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to
anything.

1094. Probability: 0.9945
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – not
an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never
seen or heard of by any Earthman.

1095. Probability: 0.9948
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.

1096. Probability: 0.9891
In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great
publishing houses of Ursa Minor – of which no Earthman had ever heard either.

1097. Probability: 0.9886
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one – more
popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to
do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid’s trilogy of
2
philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God’s Greatest
Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?

1098. Probability: 0.9918
First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don’t Panic inscribed in large
friendly letters on its cover.

1099. Probability: 0.9577
It stood on its own and
looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland.

Shaving mirror – pointing at the ceiling.

1102. Probability: 0.9842
He adjusted it.

1103. Probability: 0.9798
Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur
Dent’s bristles.

1104. Probability: 0.9560
He caught a glint in the shaving mirror.

1105. Probability: 0.9843
It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to
have known about it.

1106. Probability: 0.9717
He stuck out his tongue.

1107. Probability: 0.9630
“Yellow,” he thought.

1108. Probability: 0.9772
Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow
bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.

1109. Probability: 0.9790
Curiously enough, though he didn’t know it, he was also a direct
male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing
had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only
vestiges left in Mr.

1110. Probability: 0.9670
Prosser gripping his fur hat and
rolling it round the top of his head, “this bypass has got to be built and it’s going to be
built!”
“First I’ve heard of it,” said Arthur, “why’s it going to be built?”
Mr.

1111. Probability: 0.9864
“It’s a bypass.

1112. Probability: 0.9838
It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent’s house.

1113. Probability: 0.9840
Prosser’s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a
moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent’s house
being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin
with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.

1114. Probability: 0.9851
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-
descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape,
but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as
he usually claimed.

1115. Probability: 0.9666
This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth years previously,
and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society – with, it must be said, some
success.

1116. Probability: 0.9773
For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work
actor, which was plausible enough.

1117. Probability: 0.9777
The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name
“Ford Prefect” as being nicely inconspicuous.

1118. Probability: 0.9510
Then he would start guiltily for a
moment, relax and grin.

1119. Probability: 0.9941
“Oh, just looking for flying saucers,” he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask
him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for.

1120. Probability: 0.9954
“Green ones!” he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then
suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks.

1121. Probability: 0.9802
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing
policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse.

1122. Probability: 0.9571
The reason he said green was that green was the
traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.

1123. Probability: 0.9569
Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying
saucers down and get lifts from them.

1124. Probability: 0.9550
He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for
less than thirty Altairan dollars a day.

1125. Probability: 0.9906
In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The
Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy..

1126. Probability: 0.9524
A shadow moved across him again.

1127. Probability: 0.9585
“Hello Arthur,” said the shadow.

1128. Probability: 0.9644
“Well he can do it while you’re away can’t he?” he asked.

1129. Probability: 0.9750
He didn’t realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford learned
to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of
Orion Beta.

1130. Probability: 0.9646
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse
and Groom after all.

1131. Probability: 0.9698
Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.

1132. Probability: 0.9717
Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, “to come
and lie there…”
“Yes.”
“In front of the bulldozer?”
“Yes.”
“Instead of Mr.

Drink… but… very carefully…
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia
Galactica.

1141. Probability: 0.9560
“Six pints of bitter,” said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom.

1142. Probability: 0.9768
Ford
ignored him and stared out of the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who
shrugged helplessly and said nothing.

1143. Probability: 0.9619
So the barman said, “Oh yes sir?

1144. Probability: 0.9764
Nice weather for it,” and started pulling pints.

1145. Probability: 0.9910
A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did
a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid
hopeful grin at them.

1146. Probability: 0.9680
Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar.

1147. Probability: 0.9682
Lunchtime doubly so.”
“Very deep,” said Arthur, “you should send that in to the Reader’s Digest.

1148. Probability: 0.9537
How long have we known each other?”
“How long?” Arthur thought.

1149. Probability: 0.9686
They soared

The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was
just how they wanted it for the moment.

1151. Probability: 0.9959
The contents of Ford
Prefect’s satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth physicist’s
eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of
dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.

1152. Probability: 0.9662
This had about a hundred
tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million
“pages” could be summoned at a moment’s notice.

1153. Probability: 0.9877
It looked insanely complicated, and
this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words Don’t
Panic printed on it in large friendly letters.

1154. Probability: 0.9909
The other reason was that this device was in
fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing
corporations of Ursa Minor – The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy..

1155. Probability: 0.9903
The reason why it
was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were
printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require several
inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in.

1156. Probability: 0.9602
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.

1157. Probability: 0.9716
There’s a frood who really knows where his towel is.” (Sass: know,
be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly
together guy.)
Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect’s satchel, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-
Matic began to wink more quickly.

1158. Probability: 0.9511
“You got a towel with you?” said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.

1159. Probability: 0.9567
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.

1160. Probability: 0.9945
“My God they are!

1161. Probability: 0.9857
Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four
packets of peanuts.

1162. Probability: 0.9610
He suddenly shivered: he
experienced a momentary sensation that he didn’t understand because no one on Earth had
ever experienced it before.

1163. Probability: 0.9782
He didn’t know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of
respect, almost awe.

1164. Probability: 0.9898
“Yes,” he said gaily, “in less than two minutes I would estimate.”
The barman couldn’t believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn’t believe
the sensation he had just had either.

1165. Probability: 0.9750
“I’ll sue the council for every penny it’s got!

1166. Probability: 0.9696
“And then I’ll do it again!” yelled Arthur.

1167. Probability: 0.9542
Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and
said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn’t it just have to be the Vogons.

1168. Probability: 0.9894
Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound.

1169. Probability: 0.9892
Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet
of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board.

1170. Probability: 0.9911
“People of Earth, your attention please,” a voice said, and it was wonderful.

1171. Probability: 0.9776
Wonderful
perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.

1172. Probability: 0.9567
The huge ships turned
slowly in the sky with easy power.

1173. Probability: 0.9670
By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a
wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the
planet.

1174. Probability: 0.9625
It said:
“What do you mean you’ve never been to Alpha Centauri?

“Energize the demolition beams.”
Light poured out into the hatchways.

1176. Probability: 0.9897
Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of.

1177. Probability: 0.9567
The boat sped on across the water.

1178. Probability: 0.9626
This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of
Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret.

1179. Probability: 0.9633
The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of
the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet.

1180. Probability: 0.9515
But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the
project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be
introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod
Beeblebrox.

1181. Probability: 0.9597
It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the
Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial
Galaxy – Zaphod Beeblebrox?

1182. Probability: 0.9887
Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.

1183. Probability: 0.9952
He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.

1184. Probability: 0.9765
As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about
what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be.

1185. Probability: 0.9870
He steered with an extra arm he’d recently fitted just beneath
his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.

1186. Probability: 0.9787
For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but
fascinating character.

1187. Probability: 0.9775
This impression was
heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of
steep cliffs.

1188. Probability: 0.9847
All except the Hooloovoo
were resplendent in their multi-colored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been
temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion.

1189. Probability: 0.9762
There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them.

1190. Probability: 0.9815
Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.

1191. Probability: 0.9886
The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seamanship, as the Presidential speedboat
zipped round the headland into the bay.

1192. Probability: 0.9937
It flashed and shone as it came skating over the
sea in wide skidding turns.

1193. Probability: 0.9918
In fact it didn’t need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy
cushion of ionized atoms – but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could
be lowered into the water.

1194. Probability: 0.9903
They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep
gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the boat’s wake as it
careered across the bay.

1195. Probability: 0.9845
He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the
cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves.

1196. Probability: 0.9793
Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion
people.

1197. Probability: 0.9576
The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D; that’s what they
were for.

1198. Probability: 0.9649
He grinned again.

1199. Probability: 0.9818
Three billion and six people didn’t know it, but today would be a
bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.

1200. Probability: 0.9660
The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he
waved again.

1201. Probability: 0.9866
A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing,
glistening in the brilliant sun.

1202. Probability: 0.9685
Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in
glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed
perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock.

1203. Probability: 0.9708
Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa.

1204. Probability: 0.9541
His
heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up.

1205. Probability: 0.9648
Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted.

1206. Probability: 0.9868
The bubble surged into the
air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout.

1207. Probability: 0.9934
Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the
cliff.

1208. Probability: 0.9841
Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea
hundreds of feet below.

1209. Probability: 0.9843
Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.

1210. Probability: 0.9960
A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one.

1211. Probability: 0.9815
At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp,
rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt.

1212. Probability: 0.9850
To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash
blazing in the light.

1213. Probability: 0.9849
Pages one and
two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become
26
incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented.

1214. Probability: 0.9550
It was
constructed largely of papier mache and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched
baby eagle to break out of it.

1215. Probability: 0.9549
Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the
one being offered him by the spider.

1216. Probability: 0.9931
Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just
for fun, incognito.

1217. Probability: 0.9583
She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full
mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes.

1218. Probability: 0.9887
With her red head scarf
knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely
Arabic.

1219. Probability: 0.9620
He grinned at them
particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a
quote.

1220. Probability: 0.9785
One of the officials of the
party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the
deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the
remote control device in his pocket.

1221. Probability: 0.9804
Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped
like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindboggingly beautiful.

1222. Probability: 0.9900
“Wow”, said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold.

1223. Probability: 0.9698
27
“Wow.”
The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly.

1224. Probability: 0.9651
He winked at Trillian who
raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him.

1225. Probability: 0.9947
“That is really amazing,” he said.

1226. Probability: 0.9927
“That really is truly amazing.

1227. Probability: 0.9590
The crowd laughed
appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics
and the President grinned.

1228. Probability: 0.9541
As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso-Matic
bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.

1229. Probability: 0.9813
He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop
in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly
frozen smiles.

1230. Probability: 0.9710
His highly
domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead.

1231. Probability: 0.9878
They brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs,
which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with
breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat
with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons
would catch and sit on.

1232. Probability: 0.9553
Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons
suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel.

1233. Probability: 0.9733
This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the
hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves.

1234. Probability: 0.9631
Ford’s father, magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled
around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now dead race he christened him in
the ancient Praxibetel tongue.

1235. Probability: 0.9823
Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he
was looking for and took it out.

1236. Probability: 0.9853
The shape moved again.

1237. Probability: 0.9706
“Oh good,” said Arthur.

1238. Probability: 0.9534
Monstrous shadows
leaped and loomed again.

1239. Probability: 0.9795
“We hitched a lift,” said Ford.

1240. Probability: 0.9784
Even Ford was surprised.

1241. Probability: 0.9658
A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray.

1242. Probability: 0.9781
It was grinning
like a maniac.

1243. Probability: 0.9897
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted.

1244. Probability: 0.9578
“Here, have a look at this,” said Ford.

1245. Probability: 0.9525
“The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.

1246. Probability: 0.9735
It’s a sort of electronic book.

1247. Probability: 0.9856
“I like the cover,” he said.

1248. Probability: 0.9756
He snatched it from Arthur who was still
holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its cover.

1249. Probability: 0.9845
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate
across it.

1250. Probability: 0.9684
“Vogon Constructor Fleets.

1251. Probability: 0.9570
“But who are the Dentrassi?” he said.

1252. Probability: 0.9793
Fun, isn’t it?”
33
Arthur looked lost.

1253. Probability: 0.9806
“It’s amazing,” he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses.

1254. Probability: 0.9669
“I
came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years.”
“But how did you get there in the first place then?”
“Easy, I got a lift with a teaser.”
“A teaser?”
“Yeah.”
“Er, what is…”
“A teaser?

1255. Probability: 0.9946
They find some isolated spot with very few people
around, then land right by some poor soul whom no one’s ever going to believe and then
strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep
beep noises.

1256. Probability: 0.9718
“Yes.

1257. Probability: 0.9713
The Galaxy’s a fun place.

1258. Probability: 0.9731
Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish
wriggling around in it.

1259. Probability: 0.9753
“Listen, it might be important.”
“Im… important?”
“It’s the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T’annoy.”
“You mean that’s how the Vogons talk?”
“Listen!”
“But I can’t speak Vogon!”
“You don’t need to.

1260. Probability: 0.9646
Just put that fish in your ear.”
Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur’s ear, and he had the
sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep into his aural tract.

1261. Probability: 0.9580
“Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to Barnard’s Star.

1262. Probability: 0.9770
“Charming man,” he said.

1263. Probability: 0.9752
“Yeah?”
“What’s this fish doing in my ear?”
“It’s translating for you.

1264. Probability: 0.9962
It’s a Babel fish.

1265. Probability: 0.9666
His eyes turned inside out.

1266. Probability: 0.9721
His feet began to leak out of the top of his head.

1267. Probability: 0.9654
The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him
sliding into his own navel.

1268. Probability: 0.9739
“The Babel fish,” said The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.

1269. Probability: 0.9776
He
prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone.

1270. Probability: 0.9682
He’d got that – somehow he’d got it.

1271. Probability: 0.9735
He decided to start smaller again.

1272. Probability: 0.9945
The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print.

1273. Probability: 0.9624
“It was me shouting,” shouted Arthur.

1274. Probability: 0.9720
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly.

1275. Probability: 0.9673
The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs—strapped in.

1276. Probability: 0.9595
Arthur lolled.

1277. Probability: 0.9903
He did the smile again.

1278. Probability: 0.9900
Arthur said brightly: “Actually I quite liked it.”
Ford turned and gaped.

1279. Probability: 0.9881
Here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to
him.

1280. Probability: 0.9860
41
The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose and was
therefore no bad thing.

1281. Probability: 0.9878
“Oh good…” he whirred, in considerable astonishment.

1282. Probability: 0.9712
“Oh yes,” said Arthur, “I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really
particularly effective.”
Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts around this totally new
concept.

1283. Probability: 0.9796
Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding “counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying
metaphor of the… er…” He floundered too, but Arthur was ready again.

1284. Probability: 0.9906
Out of the corner of his mouth:
“Well done, Arthur, that was very good.”
The Vogon perused them.

1285. Probability: 0.9523
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with
his huge blubbery arms.

1286. Probability: 0.9949
“This is great,” spluttered Arthur, “this is really terrific.

1287. Probability: 0.9710
He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into
his captor’s face.

1288. Probability: 0.9954
Now you put it like that I suppose…”
“Good lad!” encouraged Ford.

1289. Probability: 0.9876
“But hang on,” pursued Ford, “there’s music and art and things to tell you about yet!

1290. Probability: 0.9714
The guard operated a control and the
hatchway swung smoothly open.

1291. Probability: 0.9643
“Da da da dum!

1292. Probability: 0.9948
“But it was a good idea was it?”
“Oh yes, very neat.”
“What was it?”
“Well I hadn’t worked out the details yet.

1293. Probability: 0.9897
He stuck his hands
behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian battle hymn.

1294. Probability: 0.9586
Wait a minute!” he suddenly lunged across the
chamber at something behind Arthur’s line of vision.

1295. Probability: 0.9927
“This is terrific,” Arthur thought to himself, “Nelson’s Column has gone, McDonald’s
have gone, all that’s left is me and the words Mostly Harmless.

1296. Probability: 0.9954
Chapter 8
The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book.

1297. Probability: 0.9670
It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers.

1298. Probability: 0.9773
Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in
Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.

1299. Probability: 0.9763
By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington
flat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally
failed to get off with – she went off with a gatecrasher.

1300. Probability: 0.9556
This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.

1301. Probability: 0.9842
As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through
the universe.

1302. Probability: 0.9627
Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materializing
in a large woobly heap on the famine-struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system.

1303. Probability: 0.9899
The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and
forwards through time in a most improbable fashion.

1304. Probability: 0.9884
“There you are,” gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the pavement as it raced
through the Third Reach of the Unknown, “I told you I’d think of something.”
“Oh sure,” said Arthur, “sure.”
“Bright idea of mine,” said Ford, “to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it.”
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them.

1305. Probability: 0.9647
Various pretend ones flitted
silently by, like mountain goats.

1306. Probability: 0.9669
Primal light exploded, splattering space-time as with
gobbets of junket.

1307. Probability: 0.9681
Time blossomed, matter shrank away.

1308. Probability: 0.9549
The highest prime number
coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever.

1309. Probability: 0.9965
The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected directions.

1310. Probability: 0.9667
“I think so,” said Arthur.

1311. Probability: 0.9572
“Who was that?” asked Arthur
“Who – the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers?”
“Yes.”
“I don’t know.

1312. Probability: 0.9792
“What, the custard?”
“No, the measurement of probability!”
“I don’t know.

1313. Probability: 0.9849
“Hey, who are you,” he quacked.

1314. Probability: 0.9717
“The point is that I am now a perfectly safe
penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!”
“It’s alright, I’ve got them back now,” said Arthur.

1315. Probability: 0.9546
A giant petit four lolloped off into the distance.

1316. Probability: 0.9573
Thank you.

1317. Probability: 0.9891
Ford was
wildly excited.

1318. Probability: 0.9957
“Arthur!” he said, “this is fantastic!

1319. Probability: 0.9807
We’ve been picked up by a ship
powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive!

1320. Probability: 0.9965
This is incredible!

1321. Probability: 0.9884
They’ve built the
Improbability Drive!

1322. Probability: 0.9624
Tiny furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks,
their fingers were inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely.

1323. Probability: 0.9920
It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of
propulsion by the Galactic Government’s research team on Damogran.

1324. Probability: 0.9556
Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly
unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way:
If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must
logically be a finite improbability.

1325. Probability: 0.9949
He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long
sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator out of thin air.

1326. Probability: 0.9785
Chapter 11
The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly
conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new.

1327. Probability: 0.9944
In fact it wasn’t perfectly
oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles
and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes.

1328. Probability: 0.9973
As it
was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the
control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers set
into the convex wall.

1329. Probability: 0.9835
Not as such, but…”
“Not as such?

1330. Probability: 0.9701
Who picked them up then?”
“The ship did.”
“Huh?”
“The ship did.

1331. Probability: 0.9754
Hey
Marvin!”
In the corner, the robot’s head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about
imperceptibly.

1332. Probability: 0.9921
It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it
actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort
to cross the room.

1333. Probability: 0.9584
Zaphod leaped out of his seat.

1334. Probability: 0.9817
Curiously enough, an edition of The Encyclopaedia Galactica that had the good fortune
to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing
division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as “a bunch of mindless jerks who were the
first against the wall when the revolution came.”
The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away to a better
dimension.

1335. Probability: 0.9502
Ford and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship.

1336. Probability: 0.9944
It was
rather smart.

1337. Probability: 0.9930
“I think the ship’s brand new,” said Ford.

1338. Probability: 0.9913
It’s a lot of ‘the Universe can be
yours’ stuff.

1339. Probability: 0.9670
Ah!

1340. Probability: 0.9653
“It says: Sensational new
breakthrough in Improbability Physics.

1341. Probability: 0.9832
Be the envy of other major
governments.

1342. Probability: 0.9674
Wow, this is big league stuff.”
Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally gasping
with astonishment at what he read – clearly Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead
during the years of his exile.

1343. Probability: 0.9775
Look at this door,” he said, stepping through it.

1344. Probability: 0.9705
The irony circuits cut into his voice
modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure.

1345. Probability: 0.9688
“All the doors in this spaceship
have a cheerful and sunny disposition.

1346. Probability: 0.9695
“Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!” it said.

1347. Probability: 0.9907
Further
circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door, and of the
humanoids’ brain cells.

1348. Probability: 0.9767
The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased little clicks
and whirrs.

1349. Probability: 0.9651
“Let’s build robots with Genuine People Personalities,” they said.

1350. Probability: 0.9517
So they tried it out with
me.

1351. Probability: 0.9885
I’m a personality prototype.

1352. Probability: 0.9933
“Zaphod Beeblebrox.”
Something extraordinary happened to Ford’s face.

1353. Probability: 0.9780
At least five entirely separate and
distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess.

1354. Probability: 0.9634
Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again.

1355. Probability: 0.9629
Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex-confidence
trickster, once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One,
and recently voted the Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe for the
seventh time… has he got an answer this time?

1356. Probability: 0.9905
“I’ve just thought of
something,” she said.

1357. Probability: 0.9532
He was
renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so – but not all the time, which
obviously worried him, hence the act.

1358. Probability: 0.9969
“Hey, yeah,” he said, “now that is wild.

1359. Probability: 0.9623
We should have zapped straight into the
middle of the Horsehead Nebula.

1360. Probability: 0.9548
“Improbability Drive,” she said patiently.

1361. Probability: 0.9973
We pass
through every point in the Universe, you know that.”
“Yeah, but that’s one wild coincidence isn’t it?”
“Yes.”
“Picking someone up at that point?

1362. Probability: 0.9948
“Hi there!” it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape
just for the record.

1363. Probability: 0.9833
The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent.

1364. Probability: 0.9552
“That’s one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for.

1365. Probability: 0.9749
“Why hello there!” they said (ticker tape, ticker tape).

1366. Probability: 0.9991
“Here’s an interesting little notion.

1367. Probability: 0.9628
She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability flight path screen.

1368. Probability: 0.9519
“Telephone number?” she said.

1369. Probability: 0.9516
“I don’t know,” said Trillian, “but those aliens – they’re on the way up to the bridge
with that wretched robot.

1370. Probability: 0.9701
“Do we go through?”
“Do we go through?” mimicked Marvin.

1371. Probability: 0.9718
“Yes.

1372. Probability: 0.9834
Suddenly it slid open.

1373. Probability: 0.9564
Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing.

1374. Probability: 0.9764
The number of things that
Arthur couldn’t believe he was seeing was fairly large.

1375. Probability: 0.9857
“Zaphod,” he drawled, “great to see you, you’re looking well, the extra arm suits you.

1376. Probability: 0.9628
“You mean you know this guy?” he said, waving a wild finger at Zaphod.

1377. Probability: 0.9887
“Know him!” exclaimed Ford, “he’s…” he paused, and decided to do the introductions
the other way round.

1378. Probability: 0.9586
“Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent,” he said, “I saved him when his
planet blew up.”
“Oh sure,” said Zaphod, “hi Arthur, glad you could make it.” His right-hand head
looked round casually, said “hi” and went back to having his teeth picked.

1379. Probability: 0.9553
“Cool it will you Arthur!” demanded Ford.

1380. Probability: 0.9844
Arthur would not be deterred.

1381. Probability: 0.9507
“At this party,” persisted Arthur, “was a girl… oh well, look it doesn’t matter now.

1382. Probability: 0.9938
Hell, she was something though.

1383. Probability: 0.9760
“He only had the two
arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, but…”
“But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet,” said Trillian wandering
into sight at the other end of the bridge.

1384. Probability: 0.9629
Its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together
not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of
physics – as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that
governed the relationships between atoms and molecules.

1385. Probability: 0.9556
She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running
furiously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention.

1386. Probability: 0.9738
Suddenly
she shook herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and
figures that charted the ship’s progress through the void.

1387. Probability: 0.9694
He was too excited about being back on the road again.

1388. Probability: 0.9896
There would be no point in asking
Zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned
unfathomably into an art form.

1389. Probability: 0.9650
It slid open.

1390. Probability: 0.9510
“See?

1391. Probability: 0.9880
It was a series of figures flashing over a screen.

1392. Probability: 0.9657
Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and reflected in
four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens.

1393. Probability: 0.9656
“Recognize that?” whispered Zaphod.

1394. Probability: 0.9692
He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so.

1395. Probability: 0.9900
Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the picture
– a red glare shading away into the deep black, the night side of the planet.

1396. Probability: 0.9549
“I’ve found it!” cried Zaphod, thumping the console.

1397. Probability: 0.9593
“I’ve found it!”
Ford stared at it in astonishment.

1398. Probability: 0.9620
And all dared to
brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split
before – and thus was the Empire forged.

1399. Probability: 0.9905
And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry:
custom-made luxury planet building.

1400. Probability: 0.9616
The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea,
where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into
dream planets – gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes
– all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the Galaxy’s richest men naturally
came to expect.

1401. Probability: 0.9880
But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet
of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject poverty.

1402. Probability: 0.9771
He
was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should have been a great moment.

1403. Probability: 0.9696
Magrathea!

1404. Probability: 0.9616
He was piqued by Ford’s sceptical reaction.

1405. Probability: 0.9696
Magrathea!

1406. Probability: 0.9824
“In a few seconds,” he continued, “we should see… there!”
The moment carried itself.

1407. Probability: 0.9634
Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light.

1408. Probability: 0.9754
It crept up by slight
degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were
visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire.

1409. Probability: 0.9898
Fierce
shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them.

1410. Probability: 0.9791
“The fires of dawn… !” breathed Zaphod.

1411. Probability: 0.9642
“The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm… !”
“Or whatever,” said Ford quietly.

1412. Probability: 0.9828
The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a
low ghostly music floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because he
hated humans so much.

1413. Probability: 0.9660
“Is there any tea on this spaceship?” he asked.

1414. Probability: 0.9767
He had found a Nutri-
Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was
almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.

1415. Probability: 0.9989
The way it functioned was very interesting.

1416. Probability: 0.9751
However, no one knew quite why it did this
because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely
unlike tea.

1417. Probability: 0.9717
The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses of the
first three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system.

1418. Probability: 0.9898
Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving.

1419. Probability: 0.9670
It suddenly occurred to
him to ask a question which had been bothering him.

1420. Probability: 0.9668
The voice said “Greetings to you…”
Someone from the dead planet was talking to them.

1421. Probability: 0.9573
Thank you.

1422. Probability: 0.9544
“It is most gratifying,” it said, “that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated,
and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your
ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the
fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail.

1423. Probability: 0.9718
A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus – two massively real
rockets thundering through the sky.

1424. Probability: 0.9800
“I think they’re going to have a very good try at applying to us,” said Ford.

1425. Probability: 0.9968
“Hey this is terrific!” he said.

1426. Probability: 0.9949
“Someone down there is trying to kill us!”
“Terrific,” said Arthur.

1427. Probability: 0.9876
“There seems to be something jamming my guidance system,” explained the computer
brightly, “impact minus forty-five seconds.

1428. Probability: 0.9533
“Right!” he
said.

1429. Probability: 0.9906
Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of
them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-
up cellophane: these controls had never been used before.

1430. Probability: 0.9792
He released half of them and the ship span round in a
tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles.

1431. Probability: 0.9674
Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against
them.

1432. Probability: 0.9648
Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a
savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system.

1433. Probability: 0.9905
The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards.

1434. Probability: 0.9530
Ford’s copy of The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that
the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of
smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on
a small stick is a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of
money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich
idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone.

1435. Probability: 0.9874
With a subtle roar the engines cut back in,
the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again.

1436. Probability: 0.9890
The computer started to sing.

1437. Probability: 0.9713
80
The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling
as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance
systems.

1438. Probability: 0.9756
“At the end of the storm…” crooned Eddie.

1439. Probability: 0.9721
“… is a golden sky…”
But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight
paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it.

1440. Probability: 0.9518
“And the sweet silver songs of the lark… Revised impact time fifteen seconds fellas…
Walk on through the wind…”
The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back into pursuit.

1441. Probability: 0.9575
“Well we are aren’t we?”
“Yes.”
“Walk on through the rain…” sang Eddie.

1442. Probability: 0.9585
A thought struck Arthur.

1443. Probability: 0.9952
Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded
contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling.

1444. Probability: 0.9707
81
“And you’ll never walk alone… Impact minus five seconds, it’s been great knowing
you guys, God bless… You’ll ne… ver… walk… alone!”
“I said,” yelled Trillian, “does anyone know…”
The next thing that happened was a mid-mangling explosion of noise and light.

1445. Probability: 0.9732
Chapter 18
And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its
way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior.

1446. Probability: 0.9896
It was somewhat
larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue.

1447. Probability: 0.9760
In the centre a spiral
staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and
next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal.

1448. Probability: 0.9988
Cunningly deployed
lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide
stretch of exquisitely manicured garden.

1449. Probability: 0.9840
Around the periphery of the conservatory area
stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs.

1450. Probability: 0.9785
As you gazed into
the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as
you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands.

1451. Probability: 0.9936
It was in fact sensationally beautiful.

1452. Probability: 0.9527
Zaphod leapt out of his seat.

1453. Probability: 0.9924
A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors.

1454. Probability: 0.9973
“Well,” said Arthur, “all I did was…”
“That’s very good thinking you know.

1455. Probability: 0.9505
Turn on the Improbability Drive for a second
without first activating the proofing screens.

1456. Probability: 0.9776
Ah… !

1457. Probability: 0.9554
it thought.

1458. Probability: 0.9795
It’s a sort of… yawning, tingling
sensation in my… my… well I suppose I’d better start finding names for things if I want
to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the
world, so let’s call it my stomach.

1459. Probability: 0.9844
Good.

1460. Probability: 0.9917
Ooooh, it’s getting quite strong.

1461. Probability: 0.9513
And hey, what’s about this whistling roaring
sound going past what I’m suddenly going to call my head?

1462. Probability: 0.9966
Perhaps I can call that…
wind!

1463. Probability: 0.9574
Is that a good name?

1464. Probability: 0.9577
It’ll do… perhaps I can find a better name for it later when
I’ve found out what it’s for.

1465. Probability: 0.9562
Hey!

1466. Probability: 0.9937
This… let’s call it a tail – yeah,
tail.

1467. Probability: 0.9562
Hey!

1468. Probability: 0.9934
Wow!

1469. Probability: 0.9934
Wow!

1470. Probability: 0.9949
That feels
83
great!

1471. Probability: 0.9848
Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look
forward to, I’m quite dizzy with anticipation…
Or is it the wind?

1472. Probability: 0.9937
And wow!

1473. Probability: 0.9562
Hey!

1474. Probability: 0.9972
That’s a good name – ground!

1475. Probability: 0.9706
“Oh, the Paranoid Android,” he said.

1476. Probability: 0.9656
“My white mice have escaped!” she said.

1477. Probability: 0.9616
It had a matriarchal twang.

1478. Probability: 0.9842
It
announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them
out on the planet surface.

1479. Probability: 0.9866
A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again in response to a
command that caught him entirely by surprise.

1480. Probability: 0.9944
“It’s fantastic…” he said, and his own voice rattled his ears.

1481. Probability: 0.9533
87
“Come on,” insisted Zaphod, “I’ve found a way in.”
“In?” said Arthur in horror.

1482. Probability: 0.9691
“Into the interior of the planet!

1483. Probability: 0.9870
Where no man has trod these five
million years, into the very depths of time itself…”
Marvin started his ironical humming again.

1484. Probability: 0.9709
Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by
striding purposefully.

1485. Probability: 0.9856
He flung the torch beam around.

1486. Probability: 0.9893
At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics – simple angular
patterns in bright colours.

1487. Probability: 0.9650
“Look,” said Ford, “you reckon this is Magrathea…”
“Yeah,” said Zaphod, “and we heard the voice, right?”
“OK, so I’ve bought the fact that it’s Magrathea – for the moment.

1488. Probability: 0.9928
“I freewheel a lot.

1489. Probability: 0.9828
I get an idea to do
something, and, hey, why not, I do it.

1490. Probability: 0.9821
I decide to steal this ship.

1491. Probability: 0.9687
I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all
just happens.

1492. Probability: 0.9570
It’s
like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the
cheques.

1493. Probability: 0.9524
“I went to the ship’s medical bay and plugged myself into the encephalographic screen.

1494. Probability: 0.9911
They showed that
I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn’t
have guessed.

1495. Probability: 0.9966
So I started inventing further tests, completely at
random.

1496. Probability: 0.9866
Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.

1497. Probability: 0.9672
to
while away the time with.

1498. Probability: 0.9898
He pushed a few buttons at random.

1499. Probability: 0.9925
There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the
major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint
little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time.

1500. Probability: 0.9725
Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater.

1501. Probability: 0.9579
He
watched two suns set magnificently over Magrathea.

1502. Probability: 0.9834
He woke the robot up because even a manically
depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.

1503. Probability: 0.9978
I’ve never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams… the two suns!

1504. Probability: 0.9511
“I think I’ll just take another walk,” he said.

1505. Probability: 0.9651
Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more
enthusiastic about its job.

1506. Probability: 0.9570
But he didn’t turn yet, not even to react to
Arthur’s yelp of surprise.

1507. Probability: 0.9754
It shed a dim pool of light around it.

1508. Probability: 0.9663
The man chuckled slightly.

1509. Probability: 0.9554
Actually you see, we weren’t really expecting to find anybody
about in fact.

1510. Probability: 0.9501
“Good gracious no, we have but slept.”
“Slept?” said Arthur incredulously.

1511. Probability: 0.9576
“Well yes,” said Arthur, “I’d sort of gathered…”
“Fascinating trade,” said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, “doing the
coastlines was always my favourite.

1512. Probability: 0.9501
95
“No,” came a thin metallic voice from the crater, “I’m mine.”
“If you’d call it a robot,” muttered Arthur.

1513. Probability: 0.9532
Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision
suddenly present in the old man’s voice.

1514. Probability: 0.9914
“What an extraordinary person,” he muttered to himself.

1515. Probability: 0.9726
The aircar sailed through the night.

1516. Probability: 0.9699
But
conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man
– for precisely the same reasons.

1517. Probability: 0.9872
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated
attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the “Star
Sprangled Banner”, but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish.

1518. Probability: 0.9835
The fact that once
again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these
creatures’ plans.

1519. Probability: 0.9524
It sped swiftly.

1520. Probability: 0.9665
The sense of motion was so soft and
slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all.

1521. Probability: 0.9748
The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were
shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour.

1522. Probability: 0.9872
They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving
their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels.

1523. Probability: 0.9929
The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was
just very very big, so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself.

1524. Probability: 0.9857
It would take the finest laser measuring equipment to
detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out
to either side, it also curved.

1525. Probability: 0.9688
In other words
the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and
flooded with unimaginable light.

1526. Probability: 0.9535
Ranged away before them, at
distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions,
delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the
space.

1527. Probability: 0.9867
No, we’ve been awakened to perform just one extraordinary
commission for very… special clients from another dimension.

1528. Probability: 0.9827
At the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in
stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within.

1529. Probability: 0.9691
The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt.

1530. Probability: 0.9535
“Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact,” said Slartibartfast cheerfully.

1531. Probability: 0.9658
Won an award you know.

1532. Probability: 0.9942
Lovely crinkly edges.

1533. Probability: 0.9609
“Mice?” he said.

1534. Probability: 0.9742
These
creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear.

1535. Probability: 0.9658
So what happened was that the mice
would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run around mazes and things so that
the whole nature of the learning process could be examined.

1536. Probability: 0.9878
“Such subtlety…” said Slartibartfast, “one has to admire it.”
“What?” said Arthur.

1537. Probability: 0.9962
“You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever
hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings.

1538. Probability: 0.9566
And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so
amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected up it had started
from I think therefore I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income tax
before anyone managed to turn it off.

1539. Probability: 0.9753
Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an
enormous executive desk of finest ultra-mahagony topped with rich ultrared leather.

1540. Probability: 0.9832
The
dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints
of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about
the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square.

1541. Probability: 0.9747
On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with brief cases
arrived and were shown discreetly into the office.

1542. Probability: 0.9781
After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep.

1543. Probability: 0.9545
“We distinctly designed
this computer to be the greatest one ever and we’re not making do with second best.

1544. Probability: 0.9511
“But are you not,” he said, “a more fiendish disputant than the Great Hyperlobic Omni-
Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and Indefatigable?”
103
“The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler,” said Deep Thought
thoroughly rolling the r’s, “could talk all four legs off an Arcturan MegaDonkey – but only
I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.”
“Then what,” asked Fook, “is the problem?”
“There is no problem,” said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones.

1545. Probability: 0.9672
Or the
Pondermatic?

1546. Probability: 0.9947
Fook composed himself.

1547. Probability: 0.9691
“The Universe!” said Lunkwill.

1548. Probability: 0.9629
“Tricky,” he said finally.

1549. Probability: 0.9560
“Yes,” said Deep Thought.

1550. Probability: 0.9600
“We demand admission!” shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a pretty young
secretary in the throat.

1551. Probability: 0.9623
“Come on,” shouted the older one, “you can’t keep us out!” He pushed a junior
programmer back through the door.

1552. Probability: 0.9525
“What do you want?”
“I am Majikthise!” announced the older one.

1553. Probability: 0.9820
“And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!” shouted the younger one.

1554. Probability: 0.9588
Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel.

1555. Probability: 0.9525
“Yes we are,” insisted Majikthise.

1556. Probability: 0.9730
“We’ll go on strike!” yelled Vroomfondel.

1557. Probability: 0.9690
“That’s right!” agreed Majikthise.

1558. Probability: 0.9860
“You’ll have a national Philosopher’s strike on your
hands!”
The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver units,
mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give
Deep Thought’s voice a little more power.

1559. Probability: 0.9642
“Seven and a half million years…!” they cried in chorus.

1560. Probability: 0.9553
And it
occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create an enormous amount of
popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in general.

1561. Probability: 0.9658
Everyone’s going to have
their own theories about what answer I’m eventually to come up with, and who better to
capitalize on that media market than you yourself?

1562. Probability: 0.9831
“Bloody hell,” said Majikthise, “now that is what I call thinking.

1563. Probability: 0.9911
Look why don’t you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in?”
He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out of the rib
cage of a stegosaurus.

1564. Probability: 0.9862
“It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus,” explained the old man as he pottered
about fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments.

1565. Probability: 0.9569
“Here,” he said, “hold these,” and passed a couple of stripped wire end to Arthur.

1566. Probability: 0.9767
He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself.

1567. Probability: 0.9805
Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured flags were
fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.

1568. Probability: 0.9594
A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly dominated
the square was addressing the crowd over a T’annoy.

1569. Probability: 0.9845
Flags, streamers and wolf whistles sailed
through the air.

1570. Probability: 0.9781
“The time is nearly upon us,” said one, and Arthur was surprised to see a word
suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man’s neck.

1571. Probability: 0.9699
The word was Loonquawl, and it
flashed a couple of times and the disappeared again.

1572. Probability: 0.9718
“Yes.

1573. Probability: 0.9607
Their waiting had not been in vain.

1574. Probability: 0.9715
“Yes!

1575. Probability: 0.9538
“The Answer to the Great Question…”
“Yes…!”
“Of Life, the Universe and Everything…” said Deep Thought.

1576. Probability: 0.9572
“Yes…!”
“Is…”
“Yes…!!!…?”
“Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.

1577. Probability: 0.9639
“Forty-two!” yelled Loonquawl.

1578. Probability: 0.9596
“Exactly!” said Deep Thought.

1579. Probability: 0.9509
“Look, alright, alright,” said Loonquawl, “can you just please tell us the Question?”
“The Ultimate Question?”
“Yes!”
“Of Life, the Universe, and Everything?”
“Yes!”
Deep Thought pondered this for a moment.

1580. Probability: 0.9894
“Tricky,” he said.

1581. Probability: 0.9529
“But I’ll tell you who can,” said Deep Thought.

1582. Probability: 0.9564
“Who?”
112
“Tell us!”
Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp begin to crawl as he
found himself moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the console, but it was only
a dramatic zoom on the part of whoever had made the recording he assumed.

1583. Probability: 0.9752
And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to
navigate its ten-million-year program!

1584. Probability: 0.9800
Yes!

1585. Probability: 0.9522
I shall design this computer for you.

1586. Probability: 0.9967
With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and scanning the horizon,
because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth
and solid.

1587. Probability: 0.9609
It gleamed like… it’s impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in
the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold does.

1588. Probability: 0.9680
He poked it and prodded it with his fingernail.

1589. Probability: 0.9838
It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he
breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath
evaporates off solid gold.

1590. Probability: 0.9872
“The last planet was knee deep in fish.”
“Fish?”
“Some people like the oddest things.”
114
“And before that,” said Ford, “we had platinum.

1591. Probability: 0.9679
We thought you’d like to see
this one though.”
Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked.

1592. Probability: 0.9682
“Very pretty,” said Zaphod petulantly.

1593. Probability: 0.9647
In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared.

1594. Probability: 0.9795
It flickered and changed, and when
they looked around again so had the land.

1595. Probability: 0.9605
The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green
pebbles – presumably terribly precious stones.

1596. Probability: 0.9667
The mountains in the distance seemed soft
and undulating with red peaks.

1597. Probability: 0.9740
Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve
parasol and silver tassles.

1598. Probability: 0.9887
In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number.

1599. Probability: 0.9609
It said, Whatever your
tastes, Magrathea can cater for you.

1600. Probability: 0.9648
And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes.

1601. Probability: 0.9631
In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows.

1602. Probability: 0.9650
“I figure this,” said Zaphod.

1603. Probability: 0.9624
“Whatever happened to my mind, I did it.

1604. Probability: 0.9944
And I did it in
such a way that it wouldn’t be detected by the government screening tests.

1605. Probability: 0.9922
Pretty crazy, right?”
The other two nodded in agreement.

1606. Probability: 0.9596
“So I reckon, what’s so secret that I can’t let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic
Government, not even myself?

1607. Probability: 0.9959
He was a gas.

1608. Probability: 0.9638
He gave us conkers when you bust your way into his megafreighter.

1609. Probability: 0.9708
On a tri-jet scooter designed for
stratosphere work, a mere kid.

1610. Probability: 0.9918
We got in his tri-jet which
he had souped up into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks,
bust our way into a megafreighter I still don’t know how, marched on to the bridge waving
toy pistols and demanded conkers.

1611. Probability: 0.9817
A wilder thing I have not known.

1612. Probability: 0.9687
Conkers.”
“The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx,” said Zaphod.

1613. Probability: 0.9880
“He gave us
food, booze – stuff from really weird parts of the Galaxy – lots of conkers of course, and
we had just the most incredible time.

1614. Probability: 0.9743
Then he teleported us back.

1615. Probability: 0.9564
He was a cool guy.

1616. Probability: 0.9556
Dark mists swirled round
them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows.

1617. Probability: 0.9790
Presumably
enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition.

1618. Probability: 0.9664
It was his idea that I should steal it.”
“His idea?”
“Yeah,” said Zaphod, “and the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the
launching ceremony.”
116
Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter.

1619. Probability: 0.9656
They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top tables and design awards.

1620. Probability: 0.9816
He picked up a paper from the top of a
pile, but then couldn’t think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on top of the
original pile which promptly fell over.

1621. Probability: 0.9754
“You know,” said Arthur thoughtfully, “all this explains a lot of things.

1622. Probability: 0.9732
Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know…”
“Maybe.

1623. Probability: 0.9904
Look at me: I design coastlines.

1624. Probability: 0.9519
I got an award for
Norway.”
He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his
name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it.

1625. Probability: 0.9713
“In this replacement Earth we’re building they’ve given me Africa to do and of course
I’m doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I’m old fashioned
enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent.

1626. Probability: 0.9546
“It sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise.”
Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed.

1627. Probability: 0.9514
“Come,” said Slartibartfast, “you are to meet the mice.

1628. Probability: 0.9676
For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said “I seem to be having tremendous
difficulty with my lifestyle,” a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time
continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of
space to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of
frightful interstellar battle.

1629. Probability: 0.9817
Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room
and they entered.

1630. Probability: 0.9673
“Oh good.”
The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian
and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange
sweetmeats and bizarre fruits.

1631. Probability: 0.9586
“Oh!” he said, with sudden realization.

1632. Probability: 0.9543
“And this is Frankie mouse.”
The other mouse said, “Pleased to meet you,” and did likewise.

1633. Probability: 0.9586
“Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?” she said.

1634. Probability: 0.9835
“Skiing holiday!” cried the old man.

1635. Probability: 0.9966
“Those glaciers are works of art!

1636. Probability: 0.9986
Elegantly
sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines!

1637. Probability: 0.9831
It was by the
merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for
122
a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good
offices of your friends.”
“Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension,” put in Benji.

1638. Probability: 0.9890
“An Ultimate Question that sounds
good?

1639. Probability: 0.9767
“You are a last generation
product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right up to the moment your
planet got the finger, yeah?”
“Er…”
123
“So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer
programme,” said Ford, rather lucidly he thought.

1640. Probability: 0.9633
“Oh yes,” said Frankie, “but we’d have to get it out first.

1641. Probability: 0.9596
“Yeah,” said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, “you’d just have to program it to say
What?

1642. Probability: 0.9654
With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open.

1643. Probability: 0.9986
“Aha, now that does sound promising!” He rolled the phrase around a
little.

1644. Probability: 0.9937
“Yes,” he said, “that’s excellent!

1645. Probability: 0.9700
Sounds very significant without actually tying you
down to meaning anything at all.

1646. Probability: 0.9978
Excellent, excellent, that’ll fox ‘em.

1647. Probability: 0.9844
Frankie baby, we are made!”
They performed a scampering dance in their excitement.

1648. Probability: 0.9708
They
emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay.

1649. Probability: 0.9911
“At a wild guess, I’d say down here,” said Zaphod, running off down to the right
between a computer bank and the wall.

1650. Probability: 0.9604
126
At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space-suited figure waving
a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun.

1651. Probability: 0.9853
“Suits me fine!” shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data
process units.

1652. Probability: 0.9815
“Hey,” he said, “I thought you said you didn’t want to shoot us!” and ducked again.

1653. Probability: 0.9602
“Yes,” they called back.

1654. Probability: 0.9957
“Because,” shouted the cop, “it’s going to be very intelligent, and quite interesting and
humane!

1655. Probability: 0.9649
“You wouldn’t do that!”
“Oh yes we would,” shouted the cop, “wouldn’t we?” he asked the other one.

1656. Probability: 0.9564
“Oh yes, we’d have to, no question,” the other one called back.

1657. Probability: 0.9857
One cop shouted to the other, “Shall we shoot them again for a bit?”
“Yeah, why not?”
They let fly another electric barrage.

1658. Probability: 0.9969
The heat and noise was quite fantastic.

1659. Probability: 0.9716
The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have
blown up.

1660. Probability: 0.9703
130
Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment.

1661. Probability: 0.9569
“Let’s get shot out of this hole,” said Zaphod.

1662. Probability: 0.9653
He
very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away.

1663. Probability: 0.9800
It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel.

1664. Probability: 0.9878
The note had an
arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls.

1665. Probability: 0.9897
The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next to the
Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then
precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on
important business of its own.

1666. Probability: 0.9595
“Very depressed.”
“What’s up?”
“I don’t know,” said Marvin, “I’ve never been there.”
“Why,” said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, “are you lying face down
in the dust?”
“It’s a very effective way of being wretched,” said Marvin.

1667. Probability: 0.9841
“That ship?” said Ford in sudden excitement.

1668. Probability: 0.9631
He came across this entry.

1669. Probability: 0.9700
“We’ll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe.”
134

1670. Probability: 0.9872
Creativity, Inc.

1671. Probability: 0.9849
Creative ability in business.

1672. Probability: 0.9915

About the Authors
INTRODUCTION: LOST AND FOUND
Every morning, as I walk into Pixar Animation Studios—past the twenty-foot-high sculpture
of Luxo Jr., our friendly desk lamp mascot, through the double doors and into a spectacular
glass-ceilinged atrium where a man-sized Buzz Lightyear and Woody, made entirely of Lego
bricks, stand at attention, up the stairs past sketches and paintings of the characters that have
populated our fourteen films—I am struck by the unique culture that defines this place.

1673. Probability: 0.9737
Built on the site of a former cannery, Pixar’s fifteen-acre campus, just over the Bay Bridge
from San Francisco, was designed, inside and out, by Steve Jobs.

1674. Probability: 0.9899
(Its name, in fact, is The
Steve Jobs Building.) It has well-thought-out patterns of entry and egress that encourage
people to mingle, meet, and communicate.

1675. Probability: 0.9526
Steve wanted the building to support our work by
enhancing our ability to collaborate.

1676. Probability: 0.9848
They spend their days inside pink dollhouses whose ceilings are
hung with miniature chandeliers, tiki huts made of real bamboo, and castles whose
meticulously painted, fifteen-foot-high styrofoam turrets appear to be carved from stone.

1677. Probability: 0.9674
Annual company traditions include “Pixarpalooza,” where our in-house rock bands battle for
dominance, shredding their hearts out on stages we erect on our front lawn.

1678. Probability: 0.9877
The point is, we value self-expression here.

1679. Probability: 0.9763
This tends to make a big impression on visitors,
who often tell me that the experience of walking into Pixar leaves them feeling a little wistful,
like something is missing in their work lives—a palpable energy, a feeling of collaboration
and unfettered creativity, a sense, not to be corny, of possibility.

1680. Probability: 0.9617
I respond by telling them
that the feeling they are picking up on—call it exuberance or irreverence, even whimsy—is
integral to our success.

1681. Probability: 0.9959
What makes Pixar special is that we acknowledge we will always have problems, many of
them hidden from our view; that we work hard to uncover these problems, even if doing so
means making ourselves uncomfortable; and that, when we come across a problem, we
marshal all of our energies to solve it.

1682. Probability: 0.9979
This, more than any elaborate party or turreted
workstation, is why I love coming to work in the morning.

1683. Probability: 0.9607
And it might
surprise you when I tell you when.

1684. Probability: 0.9934
Critics heralded it as “inventive” (Time), “brilliant” and
“exultantly witty” (The New York Times), and “visionary” (Chicago Sun-Times).

1685. Probability: 0.9931
The making of Toy Story—the first feature film to be animated entirely on a computer—had
required every ounce of our tenacity, artistry, technical wizardry, and endurance.

1686. Probability: 0.9704
For five straight years, we’d fought to do Toy Story our way.

1687. Probability: 0.9541
We’d resisted the
advice of Disney executives who believed that since they’d had such success with musicals,
we too should fill our movie with songs.

1688. Probability: 0.9575
Despite being novice filmmakers at a fledgling studio in dire financial straits, we
had put our faith in a simple idea: If we made something that we wanted to see, others would
want to see it, too.

1689. Probability: 0.9946
No, what I found
gratifying was what we’d created.

1690. Probability: 0.9826
On a personal level, Toy Story represented the fulfillment of a goal I had pursued for more
than two decades and had dreamed about since I was a boy.

1691. Probability: 0.9789
Instinctively, I realize
now, I embraced computer graphics—then a new field—as a means of pursuing that dream.

1692. Probability: 0.9764
In graduate school, I’d quietly set a
goal of making the first computer-animated feature film, and I’d worked tirelessly for twenty
years to accomplish it.

1693. Probability: 0.9559
In the wake of Toy Story’s release,
we took the company public, raising the kind of money that would ensure our future as an
independent production house, and began work on two new feature-length projects, A Bug’s
Life and Toy Story 2.

1694. Probability: 0.9683
The company was growing quickly, with lots of shareholders to
please, and we were racing to put two new films into production.

1695. Probability: 0.9611
I’d spent two decades building a train and laying its track.

1696. Probability: 0.9765
Instead, he’d founded his company, Lucasfilm, at the
north end of the San Francisco Bay.

1697. Probability: 0.9878
I couldn’t have arrived at a more dynamic and volatile time.

1698. Probability: 0.9888
Gradually, a pattern began to
emerge: Someone had a creative idea, obtained funding, brought on a lot of smart people,
and developed and sold a product that got a boatload of attention.

1699. Probability: 0.9812
That initial success begat
more success, luring the best engineers and attracting customers who had interesting and
high-profile problems to solve.

1700. Probability: 0.9740
This book isn’t just for Pixar people, entertainment executives, or animators.

1701. Probability: 0.9708
My
belief is that good leadership can help creative people stay on the path to excellence no
matter what business they’re in.

1702. Probability: 0.9970
It is an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.

1703. Probability: 0.9830
So did Pixar’s creative leaders: John Lasseter, Pixar’s creative officer, and me, and a
handful of our most experienced directors, producers, and writers.

1704. Probability: 0.9606
To ensure that these
people were always seated together, someone began making place cards.

1705. Probability: 0.9944
When it comes to creative inspiration, job titles and hierarchy are meaningless.

1706. Probability: 0.9699
If the table was crowded, as it often was, still more people would sit in chairs
around the edges of the room, creating yet a third tier of participants (those at the center of
the table, those at the ends, and those not at the table at all).

1707. Probability: 0.9847
Sitting around that table, the interplay was better, the
exchange of ideas more free-flowing, the eye contact automatic.

1708. Probability: 0.9771
Emboldened by this new insight, I went to our facilities department.

1709. Probability: 0.9593
A few days later, as a critical meeting on an upcoming movie
approached, our new table was installed, solving the problem.

1710. Probability: 0.9662
Still, interestingly, there were remnants of that problem that did not immediately vanish
just because we’d solved it.

1711. Probability: 0.9843
For example, the next time I walked into West One, I saw the
brand-new table, arranged—as requested—in a more intimate square that made it possible for
more people to interact at once.

1712. Probability: 0.9925
When
Andrew Stanton, one of our directors, entered the meeting room that morning, he grabbed
several place cards and began randomly moving them around, narrating as he went.

1713. Probability: 0.9729
It began decades before Pixar even existed.

1714. Probability: 0.9657
Standing before me in suit and tie, like a kindly neighbor, he would demystify the Disney
magic.

1715. Probability: 0.9701
He’d gather a group of his animators, colorists, and storyboard artists to
explain how they made Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck come to life.

1716. Probability: 0.9924
Each week, Disney
created a made-up world, used cutting-edge technology to enable it, and then told us how
he’d done it.

1717. Probability: 0.9776
Disney was all about inventing
the new.

1718. Probability: 0.9968
He brought things into being—both artistically and technologically—that did not
exist before.

1719. Probability: 0.9877
I loved how the concepts he developed forced people to change their
approach to physics and matter, to view the universe from a different perspective.

1720. Probability: 0.9945
Wild-
haired and iconic, Einstein dared to bend the implications of what we thought we knew.

1721. Probability: 0.9664
He
solved the biggest puzzles of all and, in doing so, changed our understanding of reality.

1722. Probability: 0.9956
I loved the
idea that animation could take me places I’d never been.

1723. Probability: 0.9664
But the land I most wanted to learn
about was the one occupied by the innovators at Disney who made these animated films.

1724. Probability: 0.9554
But few grasp how technically sophisticated these movies were.

1725. Probability: 0.9946
Disney’s animators
were at the forefront of applied technology; instead of merely using existing methods, they
were inventing ones of their own.

1726. Probability: 0.9838
They had to develop the tools to perfect sound and color,
to use blue screen matting and multi-plane cameras and xerography.

1727. Probability: 0.9685
Every time some
technological breakthrough occurred, Walt Disney incorporated it and then talked about it on
his show in a way that highlighted the relationship between technology and art.

1728. Probability: 0.9922
I was too
young to realize such a synergy was groundbreaking.

1729. Probability: 0.9828
That night, though, it wasn’t Disney’s explanation that
pulled me in but what was happening on the screen as he spoke.

1730. Probability: 0.9906
An artist was drawing
Donald Duck, giving him a jaunty costume and a bouquet of flowers and a box of candy with
which to woo Daisy.

1731. Probability: 0.9960
Then, as the artist’s pencil moved around the page, Donald came to life,
putting up his dukes to square off with the pencil lead, then raising his chin to allow the artist
to give him a bow tie.

1732. Probability: 0.9553
It’s not just lines on paper anymore; it’s a living, feeling entity.

1733. Probability: 0.9719
The
transformation from a static line drawing to a fully dimensional, animated image was sleight
of hand, nothing more, but the mystery of how it was done—not just the technical process
but the way the art was imbued with such emotion—was the most interesting problem I’d
ever considered.

1734. Probability: 0.9891
I wanted to climb through the TV screen and be part of this world.

1735. Probability: 0.9734
I remember the optimistic energy—an eagerness to move forward that was enabled and
supported by a wealth of emerging technologies.

1736. Probability: 0.9703
There
were amazing new appliances like disposals that ate your garbage and machines that washed
your dishes, although I certainly did my share of cleaning them by hand.

1737. Probability: 0.9918
The United States government’s response to being bested was to create something called
ARPA, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency.

1738. Probability: 0.9667
Looking
back, I still admire that enlightened reaction to a serious threat: We’ll just have to get
smarter.

1739. Probability: 0.9846
Life was full of possibility.

1740. Probability: 0.9698
He built our house from the ground up.

1741. Probability: 0.9858
I
bought a platen—the flat metal plate artists use to press paper against ink—and even built a
plywood animation stand with a light under it.

1742. Probability: 0.9907
I made flipbooks—one was of a man whose
legs turned into a unicycle—while nursing my first crush, Tinker Bell, who had won my heart
in Peter Pan.

1743. Probability: 0.9842
Early in his career, he had devised something called
Sketchpad, an ingenious computer program that allowed figures to be drawn, copied, moved,
rotated, or resized, all while retaining their basic properties.

1744. Probability: 0.9705
In 1968, he’d co-created what is
widely believed to be the first virtual reality head-mounted display system.

1745. Probability: 0.9910
The result was a collaborative,
supportive community so inspiring that I would later seek to replicate it at Pixar.

1746. Probability: 0.9772
Still another, Alan Kay, would lead on a number of fronts, from
object-oriented programming to “windowing” graphical user interfaces.

1747. Probability: 0.9511
As I’ve said, ARPA had been created in response to Sputnik, and one of its key
organizing principles was that collaboration could lead to excellence.

1748. Probability: 0.9857
They simply trusted us to innovate.

1749. Probability: 0.9880
We were young, driven by the
sense that we were inventing the field from scratch—and that was exciting beyond words.

1750. Probability: 0.9934
For
the first time, I saw a way to simultaneously create art and develop a technical understanding
of how to create a new kind of imagery.

1751. Probability: 0.9890
Making pictures with a computer spoke to both sides
of my brain.

1752. Probability: 0.9843
In its own way, my childhood dream was reasserting itself.

1753. Probability: 0.9879
Perhaps, I thought, I could become an animator after all.

1754. Probability: 0.9772
In the spring of 1972, I spent ten weeks making my first short animated film—a digitized
model of my left hand.

1755. Probability: 0.9920
My process combined old and new; again, like everyone in this fast-
changing field, I was helping to invent the language.

1756. Probability: 0.9906
First I plunged my hand into a tub of
plaster of Paris (forgetting, unfortunately, to coat it in Vaseline first, which meant I had to
yank out every tiny hair on the back of my hand to get it free); then, once I had the mold, I
filled it with more plaster to make a model of my hand; then, I took that model and covered it
with 350 tiny interlocking triangles and polygons to create what looked like a net of black
lines on its “skin.” You may not think that a curved surface could be built out of such flat,
angular elements, but when you make them small enough, you can get pretty close.

1757. Probability: 0.9603
I’d chosen this project because I was interested in rendering complex objects and curved
surfaces—and I was looking for a challenge.

1758. Probability: 0.9545
My film sought to address the latter two.

1759. Probability: 0.9681
And unlike a simpler curved surface—a
ball, for example—it has many parts that act in opposition to one another, with a seemingly
infinite number of resulting movements.

1760. Probability: 0.9628
The hand is an incredibly complex “object” to try to
capture and translate into arrays of numbers.

1761. Probability: 0.9515
That
enabled me to display the many triangles and polygons that made up my virtual hand on a
monitor.

1762. Probability: 0.9846
But later, thanks to “smooth shading”—a technique, developed by another
graduate student, that diminished the appearance of those edges—the hand became more
lifelike.

1763. Probability: 0.9515
The real challenge, though, was making it move.

1764. Probability: 0.9940
Hand, which debuted at a computer science conference in 1973, caused a bit of a stir
because no one had ever seen anything like it before.

1765. Probability: 0.9833
In it, my hand, which appears at first to
be covered in a white net of polygons, begins to open and close, as if trying to make a fist.

1766. Probability: 0.9886
There is a moment when
my hand points directly at the viewer as if to say, “Yes, I’m talking to you.” Then, the camera
goes inside the hand and takes a look around, aiming its lens inside the palm and up into each
finger, a tricky bit of perspective that I liked because it could be depicted only via computer.

1767. Probability: 0.9818
Together with a digitized film that my friend Fred Parke made of his wife’s face around the
same time, Hand represented the state-of-the-art in computer animation for years after it was
made.

1768. Probability: 0.9642
In the spring of 1973, he sent me to Burbank to try to sell this idea to the Disney
executives.

1769. Probability: 0.9568
The people I met at Disney—one of whom, I swear, was
named Donald Duckwall—had zero interest in Sutherland’s exchange program.

1770. Probability: 0.9576
I wanted to animate with a computer.

1771. Probability: 0.9524
Just as Walt Disney and the pioneers of hand-drawn animation had done decades before,
those of us who sought to make pictures with computers were trying to create something
new.

1772. Probability: 0.9828
When one of my colleagues at the U of U invented something, the rest of us would
immediately piggyback on it, pushing that new idea forward.

1773. Probability: 0.9846
It was easier to figure out
how to color and display each tiny piece—which we could then put together to create our
shiny, red bottle.

1774. Probability: 0.9725
(As I’ve noted, computer memory capacity was quite small in those days, so
we put a lot of energy into developing tricks to overcome that limitation.

1775. Probability: 0.9914
This was one of
those tricks.) But what if you wanted that shiny, red bottle to be zebra-striped?

1776. Probability: 0.9769
In my
dissertation, I figured out a way that I could take a zebra-print or woodgrain pattern, say, and
wrap it around any object.

1777. Probability: 0.9772
“Texture mapping,” as I called it, was like having stretchable wrapping paper that you
could apply to a curved surface so that it fit snugly.

1778. Probability: 0.9640
The first texture map I made involved
projecting an image of Mickey Mouse onto an undulating surface.

1779. Probability: 0.9830
I also used Winnie the Pooh and Tigger to illustrate my points.

1780. Probability: 0.9933
At the U of U, we were inventing a new language.

1781. Probability: 0.9793
One of us would contribute a verb,
another a noun, then a third person would figure out ways to string the elements together to
actually say something.

1782. Probability: 0.9581
My invention of something called the “Z-buffer” was a good example
of this, in that it built on others’ work.

1783. Probability: 0.9962
Computer memory was so limited—as I’ve
said—that this wasn’t a practical solution, but I had found a new way of solving the problem.

1784. Probability: 0.9632
Although it sounds simple, it is anything but.

1785. Probability: 0.9757
Like my classmates, the work I’d championed had taken hold largely because of the
protective, eclectic, intensely challenging environment I’d been in.

1786. Probability: 0.9618
The leaders of my
department understood that to create a fertile laboratory, they had to assemble different
kinds of thinkers and then encourage their autonomy.

1787. Probability: 0.9688
I felt instinctively that this
kind of environment was rare and worth reaching for.

1788. Probability: 0.9648
I knew that the most valuable thing I
was taking away from the U of U was the model my teachers had provided for how to lead
and inspire other creative thinkers.

1789. Probability: 0.9955
To pull it off,
we’d have to be creative not only technically but also in the ways that we worked together.

1790. Probability: 0.9620
I want to start with my first boss, Alex Schure—the man whose secretary called me out of
the blue that day in 1974 to book me an airplane ticket and then, realizing her mistake,
slammed down the receiver.

1791. Probability: 0.9540
When the phone rang again, a few minutes later, an unfamiliar
voice—this time, a man who said he worked for Alex—filled me in: Alex was starting a
research lab on Long Island’s North Shore whose mission was to bring computers into the
animation process.

1792. Probability: 0.9602
(We
knew this was a misconception, if a common one at that point, but we were grateful for his
eagerness to fund our work.) He had a bizarre way of speaking that mixed bluster, non
sequiturs, and even snippets of rhyming verse into a sort of Mad Hatter–ish patois—or “word
salad,” as one of my colleagues called it.

1793. Probability: 0.9608
Alex had a secret ambition—well, not so secret.

1794. Probability: 0.9790
When I
arrived, he was in the process of directing a hand-drawn animated movie called Tubby the
Tuba.

1795. Probability: 0.9880
Deluded though he may have been about his own skills, Alex was a visionary.

1796. Probability: 0.9846
He was
incredibly prescient about the role computers would someday play in animation, and he was
willing to spend a lot of his own money to push that vision forward.

1797. Probability: 0.9908
His unwavering
commitment to what many labeled a pipe dream—the melding of technology and this hand-
drawn art form—enabled much groundbreaking work to be done.

1798. Probability: 0.9756
I have to give that to him: He
had total confidence in the people he hired.

1799. Probability: 0.9932
This was something I admired and, later, sought
to do myself.

1800. Probability: 0.9855
Some might have seen hiring Alvy as a confident move.

1801. Probability: 0.9546
The act of hiring Alvy changed me as a manager: By
ignoring my fear, I learned that the fear was groundless.

1802. Probability: 0.9915
By hiring Alvy, I had taken a
risk, and that risk yielded the highest reward—a brilliant, committed teammate.

1803. Probability: 0.9724
Now, suddenly, I saw the way.

1804. Probability: 0.9534
After talking about it, however, Alvy and I decided to do
the opposite—to share our work with the outside world.

1805. Probability: 0.9512
The benefit of this
transparency was not immediately felt (and, notably, when we decided upon it, we weren’t
even counting on a payoff; it just seemed like the right thing to do).

1806. Probability: 0.9870
But one man was about to
change that, with a movie called Star Wars.

1807. Probability: 0.9736
The film’s mastery of visual
effects—and its record-shattering popularity at the box office—would change the industry
forever.

1808. Probability: 0.9805
And thirty-two-year-old writer-director George Lucas was only getting started.

1809. Probability: 0.9703
His
company, Lucasfilm, and its ascendant Industrial Light & Magic studio had already taken the
lead developing new tools in visual effects and sound design.

1810. Probability: 0.9650
Now, while no one else in the
movie industry evinced even the slightest desire to invest in such things, George resolved in
July 1979 to launch a computer division.

1811. Probability: 0.9507
Soon I’d landed an interview with George
himself.

1812. Probability: 0.9907
Even
before Star Wars, George had proved himself as a successful writer-director-producer with
American Graffiti.

1813. Probability: 0.9517
At Lucasfilm, then, I decided to hire managers
to run the graphics, video, and audio groups; they would then report to me.

1814. Probability: 0.9868
The Bay Area in 1979 could not have provided a more fertile environment for our work.

1815. Probability: 0.9780
The swiftness of
this evolution created seemingly endless opportunities for those who were willing and able to
innovate.

1816. Probability: 0.9960
This was no accident.

1817. Probability: 0.9783
George saw himself, first and foremost, as a
filmmaker, so Silicon Valley wasn’t for him.

1818. Probability: 0.9945
Thus,
he created his own island, a community that embraced films and computers but pledged
allegiance to neither of the prevailing cultures that defined those businesses.

1819. Probability: 0.9610
The resulting
environment felt as protected as an academic institution—an idea that would stay with me
and help shape what I would later try to build at Pixar.

1820. Probability: 0.9733
Alvy’s team set out to design a highly specialized standalone
computer that had the resolution and processing power to scan film, combine special-effects
images with live-action footage, and then record the final result back onto film.

1821. Probability: 0.9851
It took us
roughly four years, but our engineers built just such a device, which we named the Pixar
Image Computer.

1822. Probability: 0.9634
Why “Pixar”?

1823. Probability: 0.9744
The name emerged from a back-and-forth between Alvy and another of our
colleagues, Loren Carpenter.

1824. Probability: 0.9857
That’s when it hit them:
Pixer + radar = Pixar!

1825. Probability: 0.9544
It stuck.

1826. Probability: 0.9733
This was
driven home when, at George’s request, we developed a video-editing system that would
enable editors to do their work on the computer.

1827. Probability: 0.9854
Ralph Guggenheim, a computer programmer (with a degree in filmmaking from
Carnegie Mellon as well) I’d lured away from NYIT, took the lead on this project, which was
so ahead of its time that the hardware needed to support it didn’t even exist yet.

1828. Probability: 0.9906
(In order to
approximate it, Ralph had to mock up an elaborate makeshift system using laser disks).

1829. Probability: 0.9765
So I looked to George to see
how he did it.

1830. Probability: 0.9795
“Grab the paddles and let’s keep going!”
Another of his favorite analogies was that building a company was like being on a wagon
train headed west.

1831. Probability: 0.9868
He skipped the raise altogether and asked
instead to retain ownership of licensing and merchandising rights to Star Wars.

1832. Probability: 0.9779
George would prove them wrong, setting the stage for major changes in
the industry he loved.

1833. Probability: 0.9913
He bet on himself—and won.

1834. Probability: 0.9698
In fact, the first thing I noticed was his curiosity.

1835. Probability: 0.9769
When I showed everyone a
computer-animated image that we were so proud of we’d given it a name—“The Road to
Point Reyes”—he just stood there, transfixed.

1836. Probability: 0.9871
I told him we’d developed the image of a gently
curving road overlooking the Pacific Ocean using a software program we’d developed called
Reyes (for Renders Everything You Ever Saw), and the pun was intended: Point Reyes,
California, is a seaside village on Route 1, not far from Lucasfilm.

1837. Probability: 0.9907
Reyes represented the
cutting edge of computer graphics at the time.

1838. Probability: 0.9885
And it bowled this John guy over.

1839. Probability: 0.9949
He had an idea, he told me, for a film called The Brave Little Toaster
about a toaster, a blanket, a lamp, a radio, and a vacuum cleaner who journey to the city to
find their master after being abandoned in their cabin in the woods.

1840. Probability: 0.9723
He wanted to know if we could work together to make this happen.

1841. Probability: 0.9766
That animator was John Lasseter.

1842. Probability: 0.9611
The historic Long Beach hotel, which also happens to be a docked ocean liner, was the
site of the annual Pratt Institute Symposium on Computer Graphics.

1843. Probability: 0.9665
Not knowing of his newly
unemployed status, I asked if there was any way he could come up to Lucasfilm and help us
make our first short film.

1844. Probability: 0.9872
I remember thinking it was almost
as if Professor Sutherland’s exchange program idea was finally getting its moment.

1845. Probability: 0.9696
To have a
Disney animator on our team, even temporarily, would be a huge leap forward.

1846. Probability: 0.9806
For the first
time, a true storyteller would be joining our ranks.

1847. Probability: 0.9954
John was a born dreamer.

1848. Probability: 0.9922
As a boy, he lived mostly in his head and in the tree houses and
tunnels and spaceships he drew in his sketchbook.

1849. Probability: 0.9854
He had graduated from CalArts, the legendary art school
founded by Walt, where he’d learned from some of the greatest artists of Disney’s Golden
Age; he’d worked as a river guide on the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland; and he’d won a Student
Academy Award in 1979 for his short film The Lady and the Lamp—an homage to Disney’s
Lady and the Tramp—whose main character, a white desk lamp, would later evolve into our
Pixar logo.

1850. Probability: 0.9838
No wonder he was so eager to join us at Lucasfilm.

1851. Probability: 0.9878
The project we enlisted John’s help on was originally going to be called My Breakfast with
André, an homage of sorts to a 1981 movie we all loved called My Dinner with André.

1852. Probability: 0.9712
John
was an effusive presence with a knack for bringing out the best in others.

1853. Probability: 0.9957
His energy would
enliven the film.

1854. Probability: 0.9651
That’s John.” John made some suggestions about the
look of the main character, a simple, human-like figure with a sphere for a head and another
sphere for a nose.

1855. Probability: 0.9982
But his most brilliant stroke was adding a second character, a bumblebee
named Wally for André to interact with.

1856. Probability: 0.9692
(And who, by the way, was named for Wallace
Shawn, who’d starred in the movie our short was inspired by.) The film was renamed The
Adventures of André and Wally B., and it opened with André on his back, asleep in the forest,
waking to find Wally B.

1857. Probability: 0.9713
Frightened, he flees as Wally B.

1858. Probability: 0.9573
gives
chase, buzzing right behind him.

1859. Probability: 0.9987
John’s genius was in creating an emotional tension, even in this briefest of formats.

1860. Probability: 0.9820
It wasn’t just that the animation process was labor-intensive, though it surely
was; it was that we were inventing the animation process as we went along.

1861. Probability: 0.9721
We’d
worked so hard to create images that were better and clearer and, to make things really hard,
we’d set the movie in a forest (whose foliage tested the limits of our animation chops at the
time).

1862. Probability: 0.9537
Lucasfilm wanted to walk away from the deal with $15 million in cash, but there was a
hitch: Our computer division came with a business plan that required an additional infusion
of $15 million to take us from prototype to product and ensure that we’d be able to stand on
our own.

1863. Probability: 0.9558
General Motors was intrigued because we were
leading the way in the modeling of objects, which they felt could be used in car design.

1864. Probability: 0.9520
Because it paved the way for
Steve Jobs.

1865. Probability: 0.9823
Within minutes, he was standing at the white board, drawing us a chart of Apple’s
revenues.

1866. Probability: 0.9809
He used the phrase “insanely great products” to explain what he believed in.

1867. Probability: 0.9571
Clearly,
he was the sort of person who didn’t let presentations happen to him, and it wasn’t long
before he was talking about making a deal.

1868. Probability: 0.9734
It put me in the mind of an ad campaign that the Maxell cassette tape company
released around this time, featuring what would become an iconic image: a guy sitting low in
a leather-and-chrome Le Corbusier chair, his long hair being literally blown back by the
sound from the stereophonic speaker in front of him.

1869. Probability: 0.9623
He wanted a new challenge and thought
maybe we were it.

1870. Probability: 0.9592
His aim didn’t seem to be to
absorb the intricacies of our technology as much as to hone his own argument, to temper it
by sparring with us.

1871. Probability: 0.9962
I was, of course, already running the enterprise by myself, but I
marveled at his chutzpah.

1872. Probability: 0.9795
He not only planned to displace me in the day-to-day management
of the company, he expected me to think it was a great idea!

1873. Probability: 0.9874
Steve was hard-charging—relentless, even—but a conversation with him took you places
you didn’t expect.

1874. Probability: 0.9885
It forced you not just to defend but also to engage.

1875. Probability: 0.9855
The house was almost empty but for a motorcycle, a grand
piano, and two personal chefs who had once worked at Chez Panisse.

1876. Probability: 0.9783
Sitting on the grass
looking out over his seven-acre lawn, he formally proposed that he buy the graphics group
from Lucasfilm and showed us a proposed organizational chart for the new company.

1877. Probability: 0.9541
As he
spoke, it became clear to us that his goal was not to build an animation studio; his goal was
to build the next generation of home computers to compete with Apple.

1878. Probability: 0.9535
Still, we had fortune on our side
—or, at least, geography.

1879. Probability: 0.9837
I think that gave him the ability to approach us with a different
mindset.

1880. Probability: 0.9707
Now, he looked around our booth and proclaimed our machine
the most interesting thing in the room.

1881. Probability: 0.9829
“Let’s go for a walk,” he said, and we set off on a stroll
around the hall.

1882. Probability: 0.9768
“Maybe we
can work something out,” he said.

1883. Probability: 0.9782
Bill, like Steve,
was an extraordinarily bright, competitive, articulate, and opinionated person.

1884. Probability: 0.9587
I was amused by the fact that
each man could see ego in the other but not in himself.

1885. Probability: 0.9805
I
remember one of Steve’s attorneys telling us that if we were acquired by his client, we had
better be ready to “get on the Steve Jobs roller coaster.” Given our dire straits, this was a ride
Alvy and I were ready to board.

1886. Probability: 0.9771
This CFO told me that the way to establish his
authority in the room was to arrive last.

1887. Probability: 0.9903
In one swift move, Steve had not only foiled the CFO’s attempt to place himself
atop the pecking order, but he had grabbed control of the meeting.

1888. Probability: 0.9873
This would be the kind of
strategic, aggressive play that would define Steve’s stewardship of Pixar for years to come—
once we joined forces, he became our protector, as fierce on our behalf as he was on his own.

1889. Probability: 0.9783
In the end, Steve paid $5 million to spin Pixar off of Lucasfilm—and then, after the sale, he
agreed to pay another $5 million to fund the company, with 70 percent of the stock going to
Steve and 30 percent to the employees.

1890. Probability: 0.9798
The gestation had been
trying, but the feisty little company called Pixar had been born.

1891. Probability: 0.9976
His determination to succeed and his willingness to think big were often
inspiring.

1892. Probability: 0.9836
For example, he insisted that Alvy and I open sales offices for the Pixar Image
Computer across the country—a bold move that we would never have dreamed of proposing
right out of the gate.

1893. Probability: 0.9716
Steve, however, coming from the world of consumer computers, pushed us to
think past that.

1894. Probability: 0.9910
Alvy and I weren’t sure how to go about it at first, but we appreciated
Steve’s vision.

1895. Probability: 0.9943
With that vision came something else, however: an unusual style of interacting with people.

1896. Probability: 0.9554
His method for taking the measure of a room was saying something definitive and
outrageous—“These charts are bullshit!” or “This deal is crap!”—and watching people react.

1897. Probability: 0.9758
Steve used aggressive interplay as
a kind of biological sonar.

1898. Probability: 0.9510
It was how he sized up the world.

1899. Probability: 0.9517
I sought out friends who’d started their own Silicon Valley companies
and solicited their input on everything from profit margins and prices to commissions and
customer relationships.

1900. Probability: 0.9901
But I soon discovered that the Japanese had found a way of making
production a creative endeavor that engaged its workers—a completely radical and
counterintuitive idea at the time.

1901. Probability: 0.9962
But in 1947, an American working in Japan turned that thinking on its head.

1902. Probability: 0.9677
Among those who came to hear his ideas
was Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony Corp.—one of many Japanese companies that would
apply his ideas and reap their rewards.

1903. Probability: 0.9819
Around this time, Toyota also instituted radical new
ways of thinking about production that jibed with Deming’s philosophies.

1904. Probability: 0.9913
Instead of merely
repeating an action, workers could suggest changes, call out problems, and—this next
element seemed particularly important to me—feel the pride that came when they helped fix
what was broken.

1905. Probability: 0.9768
In other words, the Japanese assembly line became a place where workers’
engagement strengthened the resulting product.

1906. Probability: 0.9905
As we struggled to get Pixar off the ground, Deming’s work was like a beacon that lit my
way.

1907. Probability: 0.9513
I was fascinated by the fact that, for years, so many American business leaders had been
unable to even conceive of the wisdom of his thinking.

1908. Probability: 0.9688
It would be decades before Deming’s ideas took hold here.

1909. Probability: 0.9858
But Deming’s work would make a huge impression on me and help frame
my approach to managing Pixar going forward.

1910. Probability: 0.9578
The only thing that made this leap easier was that
we had decided to go all in on what we’d yearned to do from the outset: computer animation.

1911. Probability: 0.9871
Starting in 1990, around the same time we moved into a concrete box of a building in the
warehouse district of Point Richmond, north of Berkeley, we began to focus our energies on
the creative side.

1912. Probability: 0.9967
We started making animated commercials for Trident gum and Tropicana
orange juice and almost immediately won awards for the creative content while continuing to
hone our technical and storytelling skills.

1913. Probability: 0.9793
His reasoning went like this: If Microsoft was willing to go to $90 million,
then we must be worth hanging on to.

1914. Probability: 0.9946
Steve could be brilliant and inspirational, capable of diving
deeply and intelligently into any problem we faced.

1915. Probability: 0.9981
A funny thing happened, though, as we went through these trials.

1916. Probability: 0.9857
Steve and I gradually
found a way to work together.

1917. Probability: 0.9776
The irony was that this soon became
the technique I used with Steve.

1918. Probability: 0.9651
The head of Disney’s motion picture division was in
wooing mode—at least up to a point.

1919. Probability: 0.9713
“It’s clear that the talent here is John Lasseter,” he said,
as John, Steve, and I sat there, trying not to be offended.

1920. Probability: 0.9688
This offer, though surprising to us, did not come entirely out of the blue.

1921. Probability: 0.9889
Hammering out our deal with Disney meant coming to terms with Katzenberg—a
notoriously wily and tough negotiator.

1922. Probability: 0.9685
Steve took the reins, rejecting Jeffrey’s logic that since
Disney was investing in Pixar’s first movie, it deserved to own our technology as well.

1923. Probability: 0.9861
When the stakes were highest, Steve could go to
what seemed another level of play.

1924. Probability: 0.9687
In 1991, we struck a three-picture deal under which Disney would provide majority
financing for Pixar movies, which Disney would distribute and own.

1925. Probability: 0.9578
While Pixar, the company, was just five
years old, my dream of making a computer-animated feature film was pushing twenty.

1926. Probability: 0.9912
Luckily, John already had an idea.

1927. Probability: 0.9793
Toy Story would be about a group of toys and a boy—
Andy—who loves them.

1928. Probability: 0.9949
The twist was that it would be told from the toys’ point of view.

1929. Probability: 0.9904
The
plot would transform again and again over many months, but it would eventually come to
revolve around Andy’s favorite toy, a cowboy named Woody, whose world is rocked when a
shiny new rival, a space ranger named Buzz Lightyear, arrives on the scene and becomes the
apple of Andy’s eye.

1930. Probability: 0.9834
John pitched the basic idea to Disney, and after much revising, we got
the green light on the script in January 1993.

1931. Probability: 0.9886
He’d hired Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter, who
would go on to become two of our most inspired directors, back when we were making
commercials.

1932. Probability: 0.9773
Pete was a supremely talented draftsman with a knack for capturing
emotion on screen.

1933. Probability: 0.9634
In the fall of 1992, John’s former Disney colleague Joe Ranft had come
aboard, fresh from working on Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas.

1934. Probability: 0.9656
Joe, a bear of a
man, had a warm and twisted sense of humor that made his criticisms, when he had them,
easier to take.

1935. Probability: 0.9566
Well, in our
case we were already in free fall—and not one of us had ever made a parachute before.

1936. Probability: 0.9808
On
November 19, 1993, we went to Disney to unveil the new, edgier Woody in a series of story
reels—a mock-up of the film, like a comic book version with temporary voices, music, and
drawings of the story.

1937. Probability: 0.9793
Meanwhile, as we struggled to finish Toy Story, the work that we’d started at Lucasfilm was
beginning to have a noticeable impact in Hollywood.

1938. Probability: 0.9582
The digital revolution—
with its special effects, crystalline sound quality, and video editing capabilities—had arrived.

1939. Probability: 0.9749
Banished for his hubris from
the company he founded, he wandered through the wilderness having a series of adventures
that, in the end, changed him for the better.

1940. Probability: 0.9503
I have much to say about Steve’s transformation
and the role Pixar played in it, but for now, I will simply assert that failure made him better,
wiser, and kinder.

1941. Probability: 0.9782
As we approached Toy Story’s release, it was becoming clear that Steve had
something much bigger in mind.

1942. Probability: 0.9840
This wasn’t just about a movie—this film, he believed, was
going to change the field of animation.

1943. Probability: 0.9551
“Let’s get a couple films under our belt first.

1944. Probability: 0.9560
“This is our moment,” he said.

1945. Probability: 0.9887
Specifically, he wanted a 50/50 split with Disney on returns—a demand, he
pointed out, that also happened to be the moral high ground.

1946. Probability: 0.9946
Soon, I found myself criss-crossing the country with Steve, in what we called our “dog and
pony show,” trying to drum up interest in our initial public offering.

1947. Probability: 0.9645
As we traveled from one
investment house to another, Steve (in a costume he rarely wore: suit and tie) pushed to
secure early commitments, while I added a professorial presence by donning, at Steve’s
insistence, a tweed jacket with elbow patches.

1948. Probability: 0.9967
Steve, as pitch man, was on fire.

1949. Probability: 0.9925
Pixar was a movie studio the likes of which
no one had ever seen, he said, built on a foundation of cutting-edge technology and original
storytelling.

1950. Probability: 0.9758
We would go public one week after Toy Story opened, when no one would
question that Pixar was for real.

1951. Probability: 0.9712
Steve turned out to be right.

1952. Probability: 0.9935
And a few months later, as if on cue, Eisner
called, saying that he wanted to renegotiate the deal and keep us as a partner.

1953. Probability: 0.9707
I was amazed; Steve had called this exactly right.

1954. Probability: 0.9924
His clarity and
execution were stunning.

1955. Probability: 0.9685
I had spent twenty years inventing new technological tools, helping to
found a company, and working hard to make all the facets of this company communicate and
work well together.

1956. Probability: 0.9867
People seemed to walk a little taller, they were so proud of what we’d done.

1957. Probability: 0.9917
We’d been the first to make a movie with computers, and—even better—audiences were
touched, and touched deeply, by the story we told.

1958. Probability: 0.9838
There was
excitement in the air.

1959. Probability: 0.9788
I was floored.

1960. Probability: 0.9991
Toy Story was a meaningful project to work on.

1961. Probability: 0.9801
For me, this discovery was bracing.

1962. Probability: 0.9907
This would be the idea—the challenge—around which I would
build my new sense of purpose.

1963. Probability: 0.9974
These conversations were intentionally open-ended.

1964. Probability: 0.9726
People talking directly to one another, then letting the manager find out later, was
more efficient than trying to make sure that everything happened in the “right” order and
through the “proper” channels.

1965. Probability: 0.9909
This was a success in itself, but it came with an added and unexpected benefit: The act of
thinking about the problem and responding to it was invigorating and rewarding.

1966. Probability: 0.9519
We realized
that our purpose was not merely to build a studio that made hit films but to foster a creative
culture that would continually ask questions.

1967. Probability: 0.9656
Could
we replicate them on our next projects?

1968. Probability: 0.9869
Human interaction is far more complex than relativity or string theory, of course, but that
only made it more interesting and important; it constantly challenged my presumptions.

1969. Probability: 0.9913
And one that I wanted to do.

1970. Probability: 0.9727
My hope was to make this culture so vigorous that it would survive when Pixar’s
founding members were long gone, enabling the company to continue producing original
films that made money, yes, but also contributed positively to the world.

1971. Probability: 0.9657
We were blessed with a
remarkable group of employees who valued change, risk, and the unknown and who wanted
to rethink how we create.

1972. Probability: 0.9910
CHAPTER 4
ESTABLISHING PIXAR’S IDENTITY
Two defining creative principles emerged in the wake of Toy Story.

1973. Probability: 0.9665
We took
pride in the fact that reviewers talked mainly about the way Toy Story made them feel and not
about the computer wizardry that enabled us to get it up on the screen.

1974. Probability: 0.9504
The other principle we depended on was “Trust the Process.” We liked this one because it
was so reassuring: While there are inevitably difficulties and missteps in any complex creative
endeavor, you can trust that “the process” will carry you through.

1975. Probability: 0.9825
Pixar was a
place that gave artists running room, that gave directors control, that trusted its people to
solve problems.

1976. Probability: 0.9793
In 1997, executives at Disney came to us with a request: Could we make Toy Story 2 as a
direct-to-video release—that is, not release it in theaters?

1977. Probability: 0.9965
At the time, Disney’s suggestion
made a lot of sense.

1978. Probability: 0.9589
A few months into the project, we called a meeting with the Disney execs to sell them on
the idea that the direct-to-video model wasn’t going to work for us.

1979. Probability: 0.9832
We proposed changing course and making Toy Story 2 for theatrical release.

1980. Probability: 0.9627
To our
surprise, they readily agreed.

1981. Probability: 0.9907
Suddenly, we were making two ambitious feature films at once
—doubling our theatrical output overnight.

1982. Probability: 0.9668
Decisions like that, I believed, would ensure future success.

1983. Probability: 0.9944
While the creative team that had led Toy Story focused on A
Bug’s Life, we picked two skilled animators (and first-time directors) to helm Toy Story 2.

1984. Probability: 0.9925
We’d gone to
Disney and insisted on swinging for the fences, rejecting the idea of settling for a B-level
product.

1985. Probability: 0.9841
When the lights came up, he jumped right in.

1986. Probability: 0.9545
The members of this
group, which at some point we’d started calling the Braintrust, were proven problem solvers
who worked magnificently together to dissect scenes that were falling flat.

1987. Probability: 0.9784
But it was an enormous help to the company.

1988. Probability: 0.9633
Lee had joined us in 1994 and had quickly
become known for his superb sense of timing.

1989. Probability: 0.9683
Now, John tapped him as co-director of Toy
Story 2.

1990. Probability: 0.9571
We were
asking our people to pull off the cinematic equivalent of a heart transplant.

1991. Probability: 0.9664
The story, which
took place about three years after the events in Toy Story, revolved around whether Woody
would choose to flee the pampered and protected (but isolated) existence—the life of a
“collectible”—that Al, the collector, had forced upon him.

1992. Probability: 0.9507
For the film to work, viewers would have
to believe that the choice Woody was weighing—whether to return to a world where Andy
will someday outgrow and discard him or to remain in a place of security, with no one to love
him—was real.

1993. Probability: 0.9789
Wheezy, then, establishes the emotional stakes of the story.

1994. Probability: 0.9874
Jessie picks up the theme that Wheezy set in motion, and
her sassy interactions with Woody allow that theme—once implicit—to be discussed openly.

1995. Probability: 0.9665
That
is a real choice, a real question.

1996. Probability: 0.9983
The way the creative team phrased it to each other was:
Would you choose to live forever without love?

1997. Probability: 0.9732
When you can feel the agony of that choice,
you have a movie.

1998. Probability: 0.9755
“But I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”
With the story reconceived, the entire company gathered one morning in the lunchroom of
a building we had taken over across the street from our original warehouse in Point
Richmond.

1999. Probability: 0.9967
The name of this annex, which we’d commandeered as the company grew, was
Frogtown (the site had once been a marsh).

2000. Probability: 0.9814
At the appointed time, John walked to the front
of the room and pitched the new, more emotionally wrenching throughline of Toy Story 2 to
our colleagues, who applauded when he was done.

2001. Probability: 0.9818
One morning in June, an overtired artist drove to work with his infant child strapped into
the backseat, intending to deliver the baby to day care on the way.

2002. Probability: 0.9651
In the end, we would meet our deadline—and release our third hit film.

2003. Probability: 0.9803
As Lee Unkrich says, “We had done the impossible.

2004. Probability: 0.9943
And we had done it spectacularly well.

2005. Probability: 0.9831
Talented storytellers had found a way to make viewers care, and
the evolution of this storyline made it abundantly clear to me: If you give a good idea to a
mediocre team, they will screw it up.

2006. Probability: 0.9523
So for the next couple of years I made a habit, when giving talks, of posing the question to
my audience: Which is more valuable, good ideas or good people?

2007. Probability: 0.9873
In the end, if you do it right, people come out of the theater and say, “A movie about
talking toys—what a clever idea!” But a movie is not one idea, it’s a multitude of them.

2008. Probability: 0.9826
To reiterate, it is the focus on people—their work habits, their talents, their values—that is
absolutely central to any creative venture.

2009. Probability: 0.9628
To create a culture in which this was possible, you
needed more than a cord within easy reach.

2010. Probability: 0.9931
These strategies went beyond ergonomically
designed workstations, yoga classes, and physical therapy.

2011. Probability: 0.9565
(Having a
swimming pool, a volleyball court, and a soccer field on-site tells our workers that we value
exercise and a life beyond the desk.) But leadership also means paying close attention to ever-
changing dynamics in the workplace.

2012. Probability: 0.9798
Try it yourself.

2013. Probability: 0.9894
Say to somebody in the creative
world that “story is king,” and they will nod their heads vigorously.

2014. Probability: 0.9509
Of course!

2015. Probability: 0.9627
“Story Is King” differentiated us, we thought, not just because we said it but also because
we believed it and acted accordingly.

2016. Probability: 0.9501
After all, the handle is so much easier to carry
around than the suitcase.

2017. Probability: 0.9749
Advertisers
look for words that imply a product’s value and use that as a substitute for value itself.

2018. Probability: 0.9856
When someone comes up with a
phrase that sticks, it becomes a meme, which migrates around even as it disconnects from its
original meaning.

2019. Probability: 0.9928
I should say here that even as I rail against “Trust the Process” as a flawed motivational
tool, I still understand the need for faith in a creative context.

2020. Probability: 0.9786
Begun as a direct-to-video
sequel, the project proved not only that it was important to everyone that we weren’t
tolerating second-class films but also that everything we did—everything associated with our
name—needed to be good.

2021. Probability: 0.9613
Thinking this way was not just about morale; it was a signal to
everyone at Pixar that they were part owners of the company’s greatest asset—its quality.

2022. Probability: 0.9521
Around this time, John coined a new phrase: “Quality is the best business plan.” What he
meant was that quality is not a consequence of following some set of behaviors.

2023. Probability: 0.9705
Mistakes are part of creativity.

2024. Probability: 0.9773
Struggling through the production of Toy Story 2 twisted our heads around, causing us to look
inward, to be self-critical and to change the way we thought about ourselves.

2025. Probability: 0.9938
When I say this
was the defining moment for Pixar, I mean it in the most dynamic sense.

2026. Probability: 0.9871
This creates a dilemma.

2027. Probability: 0.9838
One way to do that is to replace the word honesty with another word that has a similar
meaning but fewer moral connotations: candor.

2028. Probability: 0.9733
A hallmark of a healthy creative culture is that its people feel free to share ideas,
opinions, and criticisms.

2029. Probability: 0.9924
In many ways, it is no different than any other group of creative people—within it, you will
find humility and ego, openness and generosity.

2030. Probability: 0.9807
It varies in size and purpose, depending on
what it has been called upon to examine.

2031. Probability: 0.9948
That’s because it
developed organically, growing out of the rare working relationship among the five men who
led and edited the production of Toy Story—John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, Lee
Unkrich, and Joe Ranft.

2032. Probability: 0.9840
They were funny, focused, smart, and
relentlessly candid with each other.

2033. Probability: 0.9863
It was only when we rallied to fix Toy Story 2,
coming together to solve a crisis, that the “Braintrust” entered the Pixar lexicon as an official
term.

2034. Probability: 0.9757
Over those nine months in 1999, when we were rushing to reboot this broken film, the
Braintrust would evolve into an enormously beneficial and efficient entity.

2035. Probability: 0.9815
Even in its earliest
meetings, I was struck by how constructive the feedback was.

2036. Probability: 0.9583
And largely because of that trust and
mutual respect, its problem-solving powers were immense.

2037. Probability: 0.9697
Suddenly, we had
several projects going at once, which meant that we couldn’t have the same five people
working exclusively on every film.

2038. Probability: 0.9724
The Braintrust had to evolve, then, from a tight, well-defined group
that worked on one film together until it was done to a larger, more fluid group that
assembled, as needed, to solve problems on all our films.

2039. Probability: 0.9714
And yet, candor could not be more crucial to our creative process.

2040. Probability: 0.9855
To understand what the Braintrust does and why it is so central to Pixar, you have to start
with a basic truth: People who take on complicated creative projects become lost at some
point in the process.

2041. Probability: 0.9599
It is the nature of things—in order to create, you must internalize and
almost become the project for a while, and that near-fusing with the project is an essential
part of its emergence.

2042. Probability: 0.9535
I
should add that some notes offered by studio executives are quite astute—people outside of
the production can often see more clearly.

2043. Probability: 0.9870
We have developed our own model,
based on our determination to be a filmmaker-led studio.

2044. Probability: 0.9716
We give our filmmakers both freedom and responsibility.

2045. Probability: 0.9776
For example, we believe that the most promising stories are not assigned to filmmakers but
emerge from within them.

2046. Probability: 0.9536
I like to think of the Braintrust as Pixar’s
version of peer review, a forum that ensures we raise our game—not by being prescriptive
but by offering candor and deep analysis.

2047. Probability: 0.9738
Here’s how it works: On an appointed morning, the Braintrust gathers for a screening of the
film-in-progress.

2048. Probability: 0.9810
“It’s
like I can put my crossword puzzle away and help you with your Rubik’s Cube a little bit,” is
how he puts it.

2049. Probability: 0.9976
He calls it “the grand eye
of Sauron”—a reference to the lidless, all-seeing character in the Lord of the Rings trilogy—
because when it focuses on you, there’s no avoiding its gaze.

2050. Probability: 0.9550
Andrew Stanton, who has been on the giving or the receiving end of almost every
Braintrust meeting we’ve ever had, likes to say that if Pixar is a hospital and the movies are
the patients, then the Braintrust is made up of trusted doctors.

2051. Probability: 0.9944
It’s as if they’ve
gathered a panel of consulting experts to help find an accurate diagnosis for an extremely
confounding case.

2052. Probability: 0.9737
Jonas Rivera, who started as an office assistant on Toy Story and has gone on to produce
two films for us, alters Andrew’s hospital analogy slightly, adding this: If the movies are
patients, then they are in utero when the Braintrust first evaluates them.

2053. Probability: 0.9695
This one followed an early screening of a Pete Docter film, then known as
The Untitled Pixar Movie That Takes You Inside the Mind.

2054. Probability: 0.9921
The premise for the film had emerged
straight out of Pete’s cranium, and it was predictably ambitious, layered, and complex.

2055. Probability: 0.9790
Already, Pete and his team had spent months hashing out whose mind, exactly, he was going
to take viewers inside of and what those viewers would ultimately find when they got there.

2056. Probability: 0.9573
“Your emotions—and
we’ve worked really hard to make these characters look the way those emotions feel.

2057. Probability: 0.9747
We have
our main character, an emotion called Joy, who is effervescent.

2058. Probability: 0.9514
The other characters are Anger, Sadness—her shape is inspired
by teardrops—and Disgust, who basically turns up her nose at everything.

2059. Probability: 0.9876
And all these guys
work at what we call Head-quarters.”
That got a laugh—as did many scenes in the roughed-out ten-minute preview that followed,
which everyone agreed had the potential to be, like Pete’s previous film Up, among our most
original and affecting.

2060. Probability: 0.9997
As I’ve said, Pete is superb at teasing out subtle moments that are both
funny and emotionally authentic, and this idea of bringing a person’s competing emotions to
life was inspired, rich with possibility.

2061. Probability: 0.9895
Pete is a big guy—6 foot 4½—but despite his size, he projects an undaunted gentleness.

2062. Probability: 0.9757
If you find out it’s the wrong
hill, turn around and attack the other one.

2063. Probability: 0.9814
The rats in Ratatouille walk on four paws, like normal vermin, except for Remy, our
star, whose upright posture sets him apart.

2064. Probability: 0.9977
That particular construct was elegant and effective, but Andrew suggested that another rule
needed to be firmed up and clarified: how memories and emotions change over time, as the
brain gets older.

2065. Probability: 0.9982
“Pete, the thing I want to give you a huge round of applause for is: This is a frickin’ big idea
to try to make a movie about,” Brad continued, his voice full of affection.

2066. Probability: 0.9587
So, huge round of applause.” Brad paused as everyone clapped.

2067. Probability: 0.9830
Then he grinned at Pete, who grinned back.

2068. Probability: 0.9852
Jonas
Rivera, the producer of Pete’s film, tries to make that painful process easier by doing
something he calls “headlining” the main points of a Braintrust session for whichever director
he’s assisting—distilling the many observations down to a digestible takeaway.

2069. Probability: 0.9530
Once this
Braintrust meeting wrapped up, this is exactly what he did for Pete, ticking off the areas that
seemed the most problematic, reminding him of the scenes that resonated most.

2070. Probability: 0.9949
Frank talk, spirited debate, laughter, and love.

2071. Probability: 0.9896
I had no intention of working at Microsoft, and it wasn’t why I was
there, but I knew he was nervous, and I took the opportunity to exert some leverage.

2072. Probability: 0.9684
“This
group works well together,” I told him of the Braintrust.

2073. Probability: 0.9637
That’s how much candor
matters at Pixar: It overrides hierarchy.

2074. Probability: 0.9851
The most productive creative sessions allow for the exploration of myriad trains of thought.

2075. Probability: 0.9800
Of course WALL-E would save
EVE—he’d fallen in love with her the moment he saw her.

2076. Probability: 0.9833
The
audience wants it.” As soon as Brad said that, it was like: Bing!

2077. Probability: 0.9957
After the meeting, Andrew
went off and wrote an entirely new ending in which EVE saves WALL-E, and at the next
screening, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house.

2078. Probability: 0.9840
Michael Arndt remembers it was Andrew, meanwhile, who gave a Braintrust note on Toy
Story 3 that fundamentally altered the end of that movie’s second act.

2079. Probability: 0.9885
“In that draft,” Michael told me, “I had Woody
giving this big, heroic speech about what a mean guy Lotso was, and it changed everyone’s
mind about Lotso.

2080. Probability: 0.9788
They’ve only aligned themselves with him because
he’s the most powerful.’ ” This sparked a pitched discussion in the room, until, finally,
Michael hit on an analogy: If you think of Lotso as Stalin and the other toys as his cowering
subjects, then Big Baby—the bald-headed doll with one droopy eye who acts as Lotso’s
enforcer—was Stalin’s army.

2081. Probability: 0.9716
“If you flip the army,
then you can get rid of Stalin,” Michael said.

2082. Probability: 0.9865
That was the problem I faced.”
The solution—a reveal of a previously unknown injustice: that Lotso’s duplicity had led Big
Baby to be abandoned by his little girl owner—was all Michael’s, but he never would have
found it if not for the Braintrust.

2083. Probability: 0.9641
A competitive
approach measures other ideas against your own, turning the discussion into a debate to be
won or lost.

2084. Probability: 0.9553
Brad Bird has a terrific example of exactly this—an instance when the Braintrust helped
him fix something he didn’t realize was a problem.

2085. Probability: 0.9659
Elastigirl and Mr.

2086. Probability: 0.9556
What Brad likes best about this example is that the
Braintrust helped him find a solution even though it failed to diagnose what was truly amiss!

2087. Probability: 0.9814
I just changed the drawings to make her
body bigger, as if to say, ‘I’m a match for you.’ And when I played the revised scene, the
Braintrust said, ‘That’s much better.

2088. Probability: 0.9546
They did this
because they recognized how important and rare candid feedback is and how, without it, our
films would suffer.

2089. Probability: 0.9913
A
good note is offered at a timely moment, not too late to fix the problem.

2090. Probability: 0.9917
You’re building as
you’re breaking down, making new pieces to work with out of the stuff you’ve just ripped
apart.

2091. Probability: 0.9987
That’s an art form in itself.

2092. Probability: 0.9857
I want that too!’ ”
Telling the truth is difficult, but inside a creative company, it is the only way to ensure
excellence.

2093. Probability: 0.9567
I want to stress that you don’t have to work at Pixar to create a Braintrust.

2094. Probability: 0.9865
Every creative
person, no matter their field, can draft into service those around them who exhibit the right
mixture of intelligence, insight, and grace.

2095. Probability: 0.9725
“You can and should make your own solution
group,” Andrew Stanton says, adding that on each of his own films, he has made a point of
doing this on a smaller scale, separate from the official Braintrust.

2096. Probability: 0.9887
CHAPTER 6
FEAR AND FAILURE
The production of Toy Story 3 could be a master class in how to make a film.

2097. Probability: 0.9686
At the
beginning of the process, in 2007, the team that had made the original Toy Story gathered for
a two-day off-site in a rustic cabin, 50 miles north of San Francisco, that often functions as
our unofficial retreat center.

2098. Probability: 0.9971
The place, called the Poet’s Loft, is all redwood and glass—
perched on stilts over Tomales Bay, a perfect place to think.

2099. Probability: 0.9519
Feedback would be given, and they’d go back
—literally—to the drawing board.

2100. Probability: 0.9598
So
what if we just leaped right into that idea directly?

2101. Probability: 0.9940
While no one knew exactly how they’d answer that question, everyone present knew that
we’d landed on the idea—the line of tension—that would animate Toy Story 3.

2102. Probability: 0.9839
From that moment forward, the film seemed to fall right into place.

2103. Probability: 0.9894
Andrew Stanton wrote
a treatment, Michael Arndt wrote a script, Lee Unkrich and Darla Anderson, the director and
producer, rocked the production, and we hit our deadlines.

2104. Probability: 0.9609
Two of those—Cars 2 and Monsters University—were solved by replacing the films’
original directors.

2105. Probability: 0.9644
But he deals with the possibility of failure by addressing it head on,
searching for mechanisms that turn pain into progress.

2106. Probability: 0.9682
Andrew does this without hesitation.

2107. Probability: 0.9782
The better, more
subtle interpretation is that failure is a manifestation of learning and exploration.

2108. Probability: 0.9955
Years before it evolved into
the funny, affecting tale of a fierce, shaggy behemoth (Sulley) and his unlikely friendship
with the little girl it’s his job to scare (Boo), Monsters, Inc.

2109. Probability: 0.9703
was an altogether different story.

2110. Probability: 0.9897
As first imagined by Pete Docter, it revolved around a thirty-year-old man who was coping
with a cast of frightening characters that only he could see.

2111. Probability: 0.9533
At first, the human protagonist was a six-year-
old named Mary.

2112. Probability: 0.9621
Then she was changed to a little boy.

2113. Probability: 0.9572
Finally, Boo was turned into a
fearless, preverbal toddler.

2114. Probability: 0.9822
The idea of Sulley’s buddy character—the round, one-eyed Mike,
voiced by Billy Crystal—wasn’t added until more than a year after the first treatment was
written.

2115. Probability: 0.9829
The process of determining the rules of the incredibly intricate world Pete created
also took him down countless blind alleys—until, eventually, those blind alleys converged on
a path that led the story where it needed to go.

2116. Probability: 0.9545
Instead, they saw that each idea led them a bit
closer to finding the better option.

2117. Probability: 0.9736
Armed with new facts, you can then reframe whatever question you’re
asking.

2118. Probability: 0.9929
While planning is very important, and we do a lot of it, there
is only so much you can control in a creative environment.

2119. Probability: 0.9962
This happened on a film we were developing a few years back, which was based
on a terrific idea that originated in the mind of one of our most creative and trusted
colleagues (but, notably, one who had never directed a feature film before).

2120. Probability: 0.9865
He wanted to tell
the story of what happens when the last remaining male and female blue-footed newts on the
planet are forced together by science to save the species—but they can’t stand each other.

2121. Probability: 0.9976
When he got up and pitched the idea, we were blown away.

2122. Probability: 0.9826
The story was, like Ratatouille, a
somewhat challenging concept, but if handled the right way, we could see that it would be a
phenomenal movie.

2123. Probability: 0.9535
Significantly, the pitch also came at a time when Jim Morris and I were thinking a lot
about whether the success of Pixar was making us complacent.

2124. Probability: 0.9874
We were looking for an opportunity to change it up, to create our own
little startup, within Pixar and yet separate from it, to try to tap back into the energy that
permeated the place when we were young and small and striving.

2125. Probability: 0.9928
This project seemed to fit
the bill.

2126. Probability: 0.9904
As we put it into production, we decided to treat it as an experiment: What if we
brought in new people from the outside with fresh ideas, gave them the charter of rethinking
the entire production process (and gave them experienced teammates to help carry this out),
and then put them two blocks away from our main campus to minimize their contact with
those who might encourage them to adopt the status quo?

2127. Probability: 0.9809
We called the experiment
the Incubator Project.

2128. Probability: 0.9812
Within Pixar, some expressed doubts about this approach, but the spirit behind it—the
desire not to rest on our laurels—was appealing to all.

2129. Probability: 0.9960
The idea for the movie was strong, which was
confirmed when we unveiled it at a presentation for the media on upcoming Pixar and Disney
movies.

2130. Probability: 0.9825
As the website Ain’t It Cool News reported with enthusiasm, the main character,
who’d been in captivity since he was a tadpole, lived in a cage in a lab where he could see a
flowchart on the wall that spelled out the mating rituals of his species.

2131. Probability: 0.9691
Because he was lonely,
he would practice the steps day in and day out, getting ready for scientists to capture him a
girlfriend.

2132. Probability: 0.9951
The presentation drew raves.

2133. Probability: 0.9983
It was classic Pixar, people gushed—offbeat, witty, while at
the same time tackling meaningful, relatable ideas.

2134. Probability: 0.9669
The Pixar way is to invest in a
singular vision, and we’d done so, in a major way, on this project.

2135. Probability: 0.9501
We didn’t consider
replacing the director—the story was his, and without him as the engine, we didn’t think we
could push it to completion.

2136. Probability: 0.9563
While it cost us time and money to pursue, to my mind it was worth
the investment.

2137. Probability: 0.9681
We are a filmmaker-driven studio, which means that our goal is to let the creative people
guide our projects.

2138. Probability: 0.9528
Keep going!”—a crew will follow him or
her to the ends of the earth.

2139. Probability: 0.9824
But any failure at a creative company is a failure of many, not one.

2140. Probability: 0.9759
We had picked
talented, creative people to preside over these projects, so we clearly were doing something
that was making it hard for them to succeed.

2141. Probability: 0.9536
So in March 2011, Jim Morris, Pixar’s general manager, arranged an off-site with the
studio’s producers and directors—twenty or so people in all.

2142. Probability: 0.9901
I could
not have been prouder.

2143. Probability: 0.9811
Andrew and Pete, the first directors at Pixar
to follow in John’s footsteps, had been challenged by the process but in the end had
succeeded spectacularly.

2144. Probability: 0.9819
Instead of hoping that our director candidates would absorb our shared wisdom
through osmosis, we resolved to create a formal mentoring program that would, in a sense,
give to others what Pete and Andrew and Lee had experienced working so closely with John
in the early days.

2145. Probability: 0.9817
Later, when I was reflecting on the off-site with Andrew, he made what I think is a
profound point.

2146. Probability: 0.9503
There
may be no hidden agenda, but you’ve succeeded in implying that there is one.

2147. Probability: 0.9601
Pixar’s head of management development, Jamie Woolf, put together a mentoring program
that pairs new managers with experienced ones.

2148. Probability: 0.9521
They were aggressive and extremely confident.

2149. Probability: 0.9982
The directors here who are successful are able to just relax and let
ideas be born out of that pressure.”
Bob jokes that to relieve that pressure, Pixar should intentionally do a bad film “just to
correct the market.” Of course we’d never set out to make something terrible, but Bob’s idea
is thought-provoking: Are there ways to prove to your employees that your company doesn’t
stigmatize failure?

2150. Probability: 0.9966
For proof of just how unique, consider the example of Toy Story 3 once again.

2151. Probability: 0.9619
You might imagine that the Toy Story 3 crew would have been happy when I said this, but
you’d imagine wrong.

2152. Probability: 0.9697
That isn’t at all what I meant, but I have to
admit: I was thrilled by their reaction.

2153. Probability: 0.9920
We’ve come to recognize the signs of
invention—of dealing with originality.

2154. Probability: 0.9515
In
other words, I was there to witness the creation of Disney’s Beast—and by “Beast” I mean any
large group that needs to be fed an uninterrupted diet of new material and resources in order
to function.

2155. Probability: 0.9968
To their credit, the result was an artistic flourishing that drew on the talents of legendary
artists who’d been at the studio for decades as well as the fresh thinking of more recent hires.

2156. Probability: 0.9876
But the success of each new Disney film also did something else: It created a hunger for
more.

2157. Probability: 0.9829
In fact, the intentions
and values of the high-caliber people working in production were surely admirable.

2158. Probability: 0.9848
When I advocate for protecting the new, then, I am using the word somewhat differently.

2159. Probability: 0.9626
I
am saying that when someone hatches an original idea, it may be ungainly and poorly
defined, but it is also the opposite of established and entrenched—and that is precisely what is
most exciting about it.

2160. Probability: 0.9728
I remember Andrew Stanton’s initial pitch about Marlin, an overprotective clownfish, and
his search for Nemo, his abducted son.

2161. Probability: 0.9973
His presentation was
nothing short of magnificent.

2162. Probability: 0.9582
The narrative, as he described it, would be intercut with a series
of flashbacks that explained what had happened to make Nemo’s father such an
overprotective worrywart when it came to his son (Nemo’s mother and siblings, Andrew said,
had been slain by a barracuda).

2163. Probability: 0.9967
Standing there in the front of the room, Andrew seamlessly
wove together two stories: what was happening in Marlin’s world, during the epic search he
undertakes after Nemo is scooped up by a scuba diver, and what was happening in the
aquarium in Sydney, where Nemo had ended up with a group of tropical fish called “the Tank
Gang.” The tale Andrew wanted to tell got to the heart of the struggle for independence that
often shapes the father-son relationship.

2164. Probability: 0.9971
And what’s more, it was funny.

2165. Probability: 0.9755
When Andrew finished his pitch, those of us in attendance were silent for a moment.

2166. Probability: 0.9821
After Andrew’s tour de force
pitch, Finding Nemo seemed like the perfect project with which to test our new theory.

2167. Probability: 0.9719
As we
gave Andrew the go-ahead, we were confident that locking in the story early would yield not
just a phenomenal movie but a cost-efficient production.

2168. Probability: 0.9893
When Andrew
tried it, an unexpected benefit emerged.

2169. Probability: 0.9818
Moreover, Andrew found that his intention to weave together two concurrent
storylines—the action in the ocean vs.

2170. Probability: 0.9607
the action in the aquarium—was far more complicated
than he had imagined.

2171. Probability: 0.9760
The result, of course, was a movie we’re incredibly proud of, one
that went on to become the second-highest-grossing film of 2003 and the highest-grossing
animated film ever.

2172. Probability: 0.9919
The Beast
is a glutton but also a valuable motivator.

2173. Probability: 0.9917
The Beast thrives not only within animation or movie companies, of course.

2174. Probability: 0.9661
No creative
business is immune, from technology to publishing to manufacturing.

2175. Probability: 0.9873
All of these
are extremely dynamic responses to rapidly changing environments.

2176. Probability: 0.9819
“It’s like someone
saying, ‘Here, take care of this tiger, but watch your butt, they’re tricky.’ I feel like my butt is
safer when I expect the tiger to be tricky.”
As director Brad Bird sees it, every creative organization—be it an animation studio or a
record label—is an ecosystem.

2177. Probability: 0.9525
In
response, we created smaller subgroups in which departments and individuals are encouraged
to feel they have a voice.

2178. Probability: 0.9655
Imagine a balance board—one of those planks of wood that rests, at its midsection, on a
cylinder.

2179. Probability: 0.9701
The trick is to place one foot on each end of the board, then shift your weight in
order to achieve equilibrium as the cylinder rolls beneath you.

2180. Probability: 0.9739
Interestingly, the “paper killers” were not aware
that they were serving some other agenda (which was often, in my estimation, to show their
colleagues how high their standards were).

2181. Probability: 0.9823
The irony was that his job was to help solve
problems that arose precisely because we were taking a major technical risk by implementing
new software systems.

2182. Probability: 0.9724
One of my favorite examples of how protection can give way to engagement comes not
from a Pixar film but from our intern program.

2183. Probability: 0.9913
In 1998, I decided that the company would
benefit from a summer program—like those at many creative companies—that would bring
bright young people into Pixar for a couple of months to learn from working with
experienced production people.

2184. Probability: 0.9845
Moreover, new people bring an infusion of energy.

2185. Probability: 0.9940
To me, it seemed like a win-win.

2186. Probability: 0.9871
Instead, I decided to make the interns a corporate expense—they would
essentially be available, at no extra cost, to any department who wanted to take them on.

2187. Probability: 0.9556
They were so eager and hard-working and they learned so fast that every one of
them, by the end, was doing real production work.

2188. Probability: 0.9809
It wasn’t just that the interns lightened the workload by taking on projects.

2189. Probability: 0.9740
Teaching them Pixar’s ways made our people examine how they did things, which led to
improvements for all.

2190. Probability: 0.9718
In other words, the intern program needed protection to
establish itself at first, but then grew out of that need.

2191. Probability: 0.9785
I can’t help but think of one of my favorite moments in any Pixar movie, when Anton Ego,
the jaded and much-feared food critic in Ratatouille, delivers his review of Gusteau’s, the
restaurant run by our hero Remy, a rat.

2192. Probability: 0.9823
Voiced by the great Peter O’Toole, Ego says that
Remy’s talents have “challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking … [and] have rocked
me to my core.” His speech, written by Brad Bird, similarly rocked me—and, to this day,
sticks with me as I think about my work.

2193. Probability: 0.9941
We thrive on
negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.

2194. Probability: 0.9706
But there are times when a critic truly risks something,
and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.

2195. Probability: 0.9513
The world is often unkind to new talent,
new creations.

2196. Probability: 0.9682
We recognized that making sequels, which were likely to do well at the box
office, gave us more leeway to take those risks.

2197. Probability: 0.9678
Therefore, we came to the conclusion that a
blend—one original film each year and a sequel every other year, or three films every two
years—seemed a reasonable way to keep us both financially and creatively healthy.

2198. Probability: 0.9804
In fact, Disney gave us a great
deal of latitude.

2199. Probability: 0.9962
I take a different approach.

2200. Probability: 0.9843
The unpredictable is the ground on which creativity occurs.

2201. Probability: 0.9928
Our tenth movie, Up, would be one of our most emotionally rich and original films, but it
was also a case study in change and randomness.

2202. Probability: 0.9971
Conceived and directed by Pete Docter, it
would be heralded by critics as a heartfelt adventure impeccably crafted with wit and depth.

2203. Probability: 0.9777
But boy, did it ever change during its development.

2204. Probability: 0.9715
As they wandered around, trying to get back to their castle in the sky, they came across
a tall bird who helped them understand each other.

2205. Probability: 0.9726
“I was after a feeling—an experience of life,” he says.

2206. Probability: 0.9883
For the next pass, Pete and his team introduced an old man, Carl Fredrickson, whose
lifelong love affair with his childhood sweetheart Ellie was summarized in a brilliant prologue
that set the emotional tone for the rest of the film.

2207. Probability: 0.9918
After Ellie dies, a grief-stricken Carl
attaches his house to a huge bouquet of balloons that makes the structure slowly lift into the
sky.

2208. Probability: 0.9836
He soon discovers that he has an eight-year-old stowaway (and eager cub scout) with
him named Russell.

2209. Probability: 0.9918
Eventually, the house lands on an abandoned Soviet-era spy dirigible
that’s camouflaged to look like a giant cloud.

2210. Probability: 0.9789
Together, Carl and Russell floated in the house to a flat-topped Venezuelan
mountain, called a tepui, where they encountered a famous explorer named Charles Muntz,
whom Frederickson had read about and been inspired by when he was a boy.

2211. Probability: 0.9854
The reason
Muntz hadn’t died of old age by this point was that the aforementioned bird laid eggs that
had a magical, fountain-of-youth effect if you ate them.

2212. Probability: 0.9670
Up had to go through these changes—changes that unfolded over not months but years—to
find its heart.

2213. Probability: 0.9556
“It wasn’t until I finished directing Monsters, Inc.

2214. Probability: 0.9510
But the path he followed on Up was difficult
and unpredictable; there was nothing about where the movie started that indicated where it
would end up.

2215. Probability: 0.9676
“I feel like the only reason we’re able to find some of these unique ideas,
characters, and story twists is through discovery.

2216. Probability: 0.9905
After people survived A Bug’s Life and Toy Story 2, they realized the
pressure led to some pretty cool ideas.”
Pete has a few methods he uses to help manage people through the fears brought on by
pre-production chaos.

2217. Probability: 0.9858
“So I try to trick them.

2218. Probability: 0.9638
Whether you’re coming up with a
fashion line or an ad campaign or a car design, the creative process is an expensive
undertaking, and blind alleys and unforeseen snafus inevitably drive up your costs.

2219. Probability: 0.9901
Once, when I was on a retreat in
Marin, I heard a delightful—and possibly apocryphal—story about what happened when the
British introduced golf to India in the 1820s.

2220. Probability: 0.9668
Without knowing it,
you narrowly missed being late.

2221. Probability: 0.9559
Perhaps you draw the conclusion that tomorrow, you can
afford to sleep a little later.

2222. Probability: 0.9567
Then, Johannes Kepler hit upon the comparatively simple idea that the orbit of every planet
is an ellipse, with the sun at one of two foci within it.

2223. Probability: 0.9893
In creative endeavors, we must face the unknown.

2224. Probability: 0.9732
But when it comes to
creativity, the unknown is not our enemy.

2225. Probability: 0.9715
If we make room for it instead of shunning it, the
unknown can bring inspiration and originality.

2226. Probability: 0.9576
Moreover, it’s not as if randomness happens in a vacuum.

2227. Probability: 0.9679
A good example of this occurred during the making of Toy Story 2.

2228. Probability: 0.9777
This meltdown was the big unexpected
event, and our response to it became part of our mythology.

2229. Probability: 0.9758
Hearing that, you can probably anticipate what’s coming: Somehow,
by accident, someone used this command on the drives where the Toy Story 2 files were kept.

2230. Probability: 0.9916
Potato Head, Hamm, Rex.

2231. Probability: 0.9735
At first, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

2232. Probability: 0.9606
“Pull out the plug on the Toy Story 2 master machine!” he
screamed.

2233. Probability: 0.9875
To make that process more convenient,
she’d set up a system that copied the entire film database to her home computer,
automatically, once a week.

2234. Probability: 0.9803
This—our third random event—would be our salvation.

2235. Probability: 0.9752
Within a minute of her epiphany, Galyn and Oren were in her Volvo, speeding to her home
in San Anselmo.

2236. Probability: 0.9737
They got her computer, wrapped it in blankets, and placed it carefully in the
backseat.

2237. Probability: 0.9754
Then they drove in the slow lane all the way back to the office, where the machine
was, as Oren describes it, “carried into Pixar like an Egyptian pharaoh.” Thanks to Galyn’s
files, Woody was back—along with the rest of the movie.

2238. Probability: 0.9628
But in this case, my reasoning went like this: Our people
have good intentions.

2239. Probability: 0.9967
In this
case, Galyn’s need to get her work done with a newborn at home led her to improvise and to
download a version of the film once a week.

2240. Probability: 0.9925
Had she not solved that problem that way, Pixar
would have missed its deadline on Toy Story 2, which would have been catastrophic for a
small public company.

2241. Probability: 0.9609
In other words, we must meet unexpected problems with unexpected responses.

2242. Probability: 0.9627
So they draw a horizontal
line beneath which they will not tread, directing all their energies to those above the line.

2243. Probability: 0.9609
The individual or the organization
responds with its best thinking, because the organization is not frozen, fearful, waiting for
approval.

2244. Probability: 0.9701
But human potential can
be unpredictable, too.

2245. Probability: 0.9730
My view, of course, is that working with change is what creativity is
about.

2246. Probability: 0.9967
He woos her by giving her a rare and treasured
gift—the ability to see the future—and, in response, she agrees to be his consort.

2247. Probability: 0.9563
They had management and operational skills; they had grand
ambitions; they didn’t think they were making bad decisions, nor did they think they were
being arrogant.

2248. Probability: 0.9824
Imagine a door that, when you swing it open, reveals the universe of all that you do not
and cannot know.

2249. Probability: 0.9658
Let’s go down another layer.

2250. Probability: 0.9589
What’s not to like about that?

2251. Probability: 0.9914
In a healthy, creative culture, the people in the trenches feel free
to speak up and bring to light differing views that can help give us clarity.

2252. Probability: 0.9863
A visual effects
producer named Denise Ream was in that meeting, and she spoke up with a fairly radical
suggestion: Production would be cheaper and take fewer person-weeks (the measure—the
amount of work a single person could accomplish in a week’s time—that we use to calculate
budgets) if we did something that sounded completely counter to that goal—delay when the
animators started on their work.

2253. Probability: 0.9619
And it paid off.”
That couldn’t have happened if the producer of the movie—and the company’s leadership
in general—hadn’t been open to a new viewpoint that challenged the status quo.

2254. Probability: 0.9572
You can turn back the clock a bit more and say that those babies’ parents might never have
met if John didn’t join the production of The Adventures of André and Wally B.

2255. Probability: 0.9837
If animators
want a character to reach for something to their left, they anticipate that a split-second
earlier by having the character move ever so subtly to the right.

2256. Probability: 0.9553
We can use that tell to guide the audience’s eyes wherever we want them to look.

2257. Probability: 0.9709
Or
conversely, if we want to surprise people, we can leave it out, making the unforeseen motion
more startling.

2258. Probability: 0.9628
Seeing this little motion, you sense her state of mind, perhaps
without even knowing why.

2259. Probability: 0.9680
This is all based on how we actually function, and it isn’t what we normally assume.

2260. Probability: 0.9576
We
fill in or make up a great deal more than we think we do.

2261. Probability: 0.9822
We are meaning-making creatures who
read other people’s subtle clues just as they read ours.

2262. Probability: 0.9900
One way to understand the implications of how our mental models work is to consider the
magician’s sleight of hand.

2263. Probability: 0.9839
As he or she makes, say, a coin or a playing card disappear, we
take delight in being fooled, and our eyes dart about, trying to divine the trick.

2264. Probability: 0.9949
The illusion that we have a
complete picture is extraordinarily persuasive.

2265. Probability: 0.9737
But they are each unique to us—no one can see
relationships quite the way we do.

2266. Probability: 0.9930
In a creative environment, those
differences can be assets.

2267. Probability: 0.9893
Somehow, though, this episode led Pixar’s directors to decide that, going forward, they
should write the first drafts of their movies and thus be credited as writers.

2268. Probability: 0.9535
The tool is not reality.

2269. Probability: 0.9762
We are making decisions, one by one, to create it.

2270. Probability: 0.9503
There is hope, however.

2271. Probability: 0.9811
The most creative people are willing to work in the shadow of
uncertainty.

2272. Probability: 0.9628
That’s because they believe
that, through questioning, they can do more than merely look through the door.

2273. Probability: 0.9886
They can
venture across its threshold.

2274. Probability: 0.9723
There are others who venture into the unknown with surprising success but with little
understanding of what they have done.

2275. Probability: 0.9881
Believing in their cleverness, they revel in their
brilliance, telling others about the importance of taking risks.

2276. Probability: 0.9730
I believe that we all have the potential to solve problems and
express ourselves creatively.

2277. Probability: 0.9939
We rented one of those giant campers with two rear wheels on each side
so that if one wheel blew, the other would still hold the camper up.

2278. Probability: 0.9870
Instead of taking the New Jersey Turnpike,
which probably would have been the prudent thing to do, we took an alternate route because
it didn’t have tolls; we were being cheap.

2279. Probability: 0.9612
Their mental models, forged by years of interacting with one
another, altered their interpretation of straightforward events—we had dinged a curb and
popped a tire—and blinded them to the danger we could be in if we didn’t pull over and take
care of the problem immediately.

2280. Probability: 0.9944
This story—the oversized vehicle, the oblivious couple, the shredded tire, the
Honeymooners-level sniping that ensued—has an element of dark humor, for sure, but I tell it
here because it demonstrates four ideas that inform the way I think about managing.

2281. Probability: 0.9665
Now, consider this: The tire incident involved the interconnected models of just two
people.

2282. Probability: 0.9833
Integrating Technology and Art
5.

2283. Probability: 0.9755
The director Mark Andrews,
meanwhile, is not the groggy type.

2284. Probability: 0.9625
By the time he bounded into the room, he’d already spent
an hour outside on the lawn, thrusting and parrying—he’s an avid fencer—with a thirty-
eight-inch longsword.

2285. Probability: 0.9812
Mark had stepped in to direct Brave midway through production at the request of John and
myself, and he was widely seen as an inspiring leader.

2286. Probability: 0.9675
A proud descendant of Scotland, where
Brave is set, Mark urged his crew to join him in wearing a kilt to work every Friday (he likes
to say that men in skirts boost morale).

2287. Probability: 0.9812
Many viewed him as nothing short of a force of
nature.

2288. Probability: 0.9722
“Mark talks to you as if he’s trying to drown out an F5 class tornado behind him—and
winning,” is how one animator described him.

2289. Probability: 0.9714
Dailies are a key part of Pixar culture, not just because of what they accomplish—
constructive midstream feedback—but because of how they accomplish it.

2290. Probability: 0.9805
Mark Andrews did this at the Brave meeting by being
irrepressible: singing ’80s songs, reveling in people’s nicknames (Wu-dog!

2291. Probability: 0.9694
Bang!”
Whether or not all the animators would get that same go-ahead, everyone could count on
this: When each finished his or her presentation, the room would burst into applause.

2292. Probability: 0.9848
The facial expression of a young spy?

2293. Probability: 0.9788
“She looks like she’s stepping more catlike
than heavy-bear-like,” he said.

2294. Probability: 0.9729
She’s
walking like a ninja.” Everybody nodded and—note taken—they moved on.

2295. Probability: 0.9601
Dailies are master classes in how to see and think more expansively, and their impact can
be felt throughout the building.

2296. Probability: 0.9853
When they realize this, the embarrassment goes
away—and when the embarrassment goes away, people become more creative.

2297. Probability: 0.9864
The whole activity becomes socially rewarding and productive.

2298. Probability: 0.9914
The walls of the room were covered with large
corkboards, which were filled with illustrations of what happens in each act, as well as
drawings of characters and collages of inspirational artwork.

2299. Probability: 0.9636
To give a sense of the overall
flavor of the film, the directors had posted dozens of images from well-known movies that
they felt were in a similar visual and contextual vein: panoramic shots they hoped to mimic,
landscapes they found inspiring, character studies that showed costumes like the ones they
planned to use.

2300. Probability: 0.9612
“And then they’d have her wave
her hands like Frank Thomas had Fauna do in Sleeping Beauty.

2301. Probability: 0.9719
At his
urging, when Pixar was prepping a movie about a Parisian rat who aspires to be a gourmet
chef, for example, several members of Ratatouille’s team went to France and spent two weeks
dining in extraordinary, Michelin-starred restaurants, visiting their kitchens, and interviewing
their chefs.

2302. Probability: 0.9828
(They also trudged through the Paris sewers, where many a rat makes his home.)
When it was decided that Carl Fredrickson’s balloon-propelled house would sail to the
mountains of South America in Up, John sent a group of artists to see the tepuis in Venezuela
up close; not only that, but an ostrich was brought into Pixar’s headquarters to inspire the
animators who were modeling the giant bird character.

2303. Probability: 0.9765
And when a plotline emerged in
Finding Nemo that required Nemo, who believed that all drains lead to the ocean, to escape
from a dentist’s office by jumping into a sink, a trip was arranged to the San Francisco sewage
treatment plant.

2304. Probability: 0.9518
(And yes, the filmmakers learned, it is possible for a fish to get from the
drain to the sea without being killed.) Many of the crew on Finding Nemo also became scuba-
certified.

2305. Probability: 0.9884
These experiences are more than field trips or diversions.

2306. Probability: 0.9631
Because they take place early in
the filmmaking process, they fuel the film’s development.

2307. Probability: 0.9757
In December 2009, more than three years before the movie premiered in theaters, a
dozen people from Pixar—the director, producer, and writers, as well as several people from
the art and story departments—flew east to visit MIT, Harvard, and Princeton.

2308. Probability: 0.9823
They fuel inspiration.

2309. Probability: 0.9755
It just
feels right.

2310. Probability: 0.9713
It’s a hidden engine, an unspoken contract with the viewer that says: We are
striving to tell you something impactful and true.

2311. Probability: 0.9699
It occurs when a bewildered Boo first arrives in Mike and
Sulley’s apartment and begins, as toddlers do, to explore.

2312. Probability: 0.9625
As the monsters try to contain her,
she wanders up to two towering piles of compact discs—more than ninety in all.

2313. Probability: 0.9759
The moment is
over in three seconds, and during it, only a few of the CD cases are at all visible.

2314. Probability: 0.9893
But for every
one of those CDs, Pixar artists created not just a CD cover but a shader—a program that
calculates how an object’s rendering changes as it moves.

2315. Probability: 0.9635
Was it fun to design them all?

2316. Probability: 0.9776
Yes.

2317. Probability: 0.9645
Limits force us to rethink how we are working and push us to new heights
of creativity.

2318. Probability: 0.9628
In any creative endeavor, there is a long list of features and effects that you want to include
to nudge it toward greatness—a very long list.

2319. Probability: 0.9790
He wanted them to move and flicker in a way that evoked flames in a fireplace—he
was fixated, in fact, on realizing the vision in his head.

2320. Probability: 0.9908
Luckily, Brad had a producer, John Walker, who came up with a system (in collaboration
with a department manager, Laura Reynolds) that would help the crew see what was possible
given the available resources.

2321. Probability: 0.9766
John’s system consisted of popsicle sticks stuck to a wall with
Velcro.

2322. Probability: 0.9778
“And I
could point to the wall and say, ‘Well, you need another stick, then.

2323. Probability: 0.9971
Because we only have so many.’ ” I see this as a great example of the
positive creative impact of limits.

2324. Probability: 0.9759
When John and I arrived at Disney
Animation in 2006, we encountered an interesting conflict.

2325. Probability: 0.9507
As soon as
we made the change, the war ended and production began running much more smoothly.

2326. Probability: 0.9954
McCrea in WALL-E—and he helped shape the
creative sensibilities of many of the people who would go on to define Pixar.

2327. Probability: 0.9889
He brought sound and color
into animation.

2328. Probability: 0.9929
He developed matting for filmmaking, the multiplane camera, the Xerox
room for animation cels.

2329. Probability: 0.9785
Our business model, our way of making films, and our
technology continually changed, but by integrating them we let them drive each other.

2330. Probability: 0.9603
The
impetus for innovation, in other words, came from the inside rather than the outside.

2331. Probability: 0.9537
When everything
is functioning as it should be, art and technology play off each other and spur each other to
new heights.

2332. Probability: 0.9632
But in my view, the effort is always worth it.

2333. Probability: 0.9770
If we can constantly change and improve our models by using technology in the
pursuit of art, we keep ourselves fresh.

2334. Probability: 0.9873
The whole history of Pixar is a testament to this
dynamic interplay.

2335. Probability: 0.9710
Brad asked if
there was a way that he could draw on top of a projected image—a scene that was in the
process of being animated—to communicate to animators the changes he wanted and to do so
more effectively.

2336. Probability: 0.9723
(This is
what Mark Andrews used in the dailies session I described.)
Another key innovation occurred after a frustrated Pete Docter stopped by my office one
day in 2002.

2337. Probability: 0.9756
Two weeks later,
Michael came back with a prototype that would later become known as “Pitch Docter,” in
homage to Pete.

2338. Probability: 0.9977
A pitch is dynamic.

2339. Probability: 0.9874
The director is able to look the audience in the eye, see how the
various elements are playing, and adjust on the fly.

2340. Probability: 0.9818
Pitch Docter did that.

2341. Probability: 0.9613
It allowed those giving
feedback to evaluate the material by simulating its presentation in film.

2342. Probability: 0.9544
Soon, though, they saw its advantages.

2343. Probability: 0.9849
The software developers
and the artists worked together to move the tools forward, and the model of how the artists
did their work changed as the software evolved to meet their needs.

2344. Probability: 0.9943
This process was driven both by requests from artists and suggestions from programmers—
a back and forth that came about because of the integration of technology and art.

2345. Probability: 0.9986
This way of doing things is
responsive; it is nimble—and it makes us better.

2346. Probability: 0.9859
Our short films are Pixar’s way of experimenting, and we produce them in the hopes of
getting exactly these kinds of glimpses.

2347. Probability: 0.9635
What sustains them is a
kind of gut feeling that making shorts is a good thing to do.

2348. Probability: 0.9699
Our first wave of Pixar shorts—including Luxo
Jr., Red’s Dream, and the Oscar-winning Tin Toy—were a way of sharing technological
innovations with our colleagues in the scientific community.

2349. Probability: 0.9682
But in 1996, a year after the release of Toy Story, John and I decided
it was important to reinvigorate our short film program.

2350. Probability: 0.9570
Our hope was that making shorts
would encourage experimentation and, more important, become a proving ground for
fledgling filmmakers we hoped would go on to direct features someday.

2351. Probability: 0.9561
Geri’s Game, which was screened in front of A Bug’s Life in 1998, was the first of what we
came to call our second-generation shorts.

2352. Probability: 0.9974
The humor is located in the way the octogenarian’s
personality changes as he switches from one side of the board to the other.

2353. Probability: 0.9976
When his meeker
persona beats his gloating alter ego by (literally) turning the tables, you can’t help but laugh.

2354. Probability: 0.9775
But here was what mattered: In addition to being a delightful film, Geri’s Game helped us
improve technically.

2355. Probability: 0.9857
That needed to change, and Geri’s Game was an opportunity to start working that out.

2356. Probability: 0.9658
While we’d used R&D to justify the program initially, we soon realized that our feature
films were the major drivers of technological innovation—not our shorts.

2357. Probability: 0.9889
And yet, for all our faulty assumptions, the shorts accomplished other things for Pixar.

2358. Probability: 0.9928
Our shorts also create a deeper value in two key areas.

2359. Probability: 0.9529
We liked his work and sensibility but sensed it would be wise
to try him out on a short first to determine not only whether he had filmmaking chops but
also if he could work well with others.

2360. Probability: 0.9956
The film he delivered clocked
in at twelve minutes—more of a “medium” than a “short.” But length is flexible; the real
problem was that although the director was extraordinarily creative, he was unable to settle
on a spine for a story.

2361. Probability: 0.9724
But we consider it money well spent.

2362. Probability: 0.9901
We called this program Pixar University, and I
hired a first-rate technical trainer to run it.

2363. Probability: 0.9944
It is easy to justify a training program, but I had another
agenda, and in trying to accomplish it, we would find surprising bonuses.

2364. Probability: 0.9895
They place an object upside
down, for example, so that each student can look at it as a pure shape and not as a familiar,
recognizable thing (a shoe, say).

2365. Probability: 0.9885
Drawing the “un-
chair” can be a sort of metaphor for increasing perceptivity.

2366. Probability: 0.9538
Our filmmakers have become skilled at not getting caught up in a
problem but instead looking elsewhere in the story for solutions.

2367. Probability: 0.9853
To keep anyone from going on too long (we had a fifteen-minute
limit), someone brought in a kitchen timer in the shape of a rooster.

2368. Probability: 0.9730
Here we were, talking
about some of the most high-tech animation ever done, and we were managing the process
with an old kitchen utensil.

2369. Probability: 0.9645
Everyone was proud, not only of the film but of how committed
we were to the culture from which the film had sprung.

2370. Probability: 0.9673
Postmortems are a rare opportunity to do analysis that simply wasn’t possible in the heat of
the project.

2371. Probability: 0.9794
Teach Others Who Weren’t There
Even if everyone involved in a production understands what it taught them, the postmortem
is a great way of passing on the positive and negative lessons to other people who were not
on the project.

2372. Probability: 0.9715
So try “mid-mortems” or
narrow the focus of your postmortem to special topics.

2373. Probability: 0.9735
Our first task force dramatically altered the way we thought
about scheduling.

2374. Probability: 0.9907
Because we’re a creative organization, people tend to assume
that much of what we do can’t be measured or analyzed.

2375. Probability: 0.9883
But it gives us something to work with to reveal
potential patterns, which can be used to feed discussions that help us improve.

2376. Probability: 0.9872
Sculpting, painting, acting, meditation, belly dancing, live-
action filmmaking, computer programming, design and color theory, ballet—over the years,
we have offered free classes in all of them.

2377. Probability: 0.9821
Instead,
there was something about an apprentice lighting technician sitting alongside an experienced
animator, who in turn was sitting next to someone who worked in legal or accounting or
security—that proved immensely valuable.

2378. Probability: 0.9828
They felt free to be goofy, relaxed, open, vulnerable.

2379. Probability: 0.9709
Hierarchy did not apply, and as a result, communication thrived.

2380. Probability: 0.9765
Simply by providing an
excuse for us all to toil side by side, humbled by the challenge of sketching a self-portrait or
writing computer code or taming a lump of clay, P.U.

2381. Probability: 0.9883
changed the culture for the better.

2382. Probability: 0.9830
And I’ll admit that these social interactions I
describe were an unexpected benefit.

2383. Probability: 0.9808
Instead, it was to send a signal about how important
it is for every one of us to keep learning new things.

2384. Probability: 0.9626
lets our people do, and I believe it makes us stronger.

2385. Probability: 0.9574
As I walked up and down the hallways, looking at the
paintings and sketches made by kids in grades K through 5, I noticed that the first- and
second-graders’ drawings looked better and fresher than those of the fifth-graders.

2386. Probability: 0.9670
Because it makes room for the views of
others.

2387. Probability: 0.9565
It allows us to begin to trust them—and, more important, to hear them.

2388. Probability: 0.9592
It makes us
willing to experiment, and it makes it safe to try something that may fail.

2389. Probability: 0.9900
Then that visionary leads a team of people through
hardship to finally deliver on that great promise.

2390. Probability: 0.9903
In my experience, creative people discover and realize their visions over time and through
dedicated, protracted struggle.

2391. Probability: 0.9814
In that way, creativity is more like a marathon than a sprint.

2392. Probability: 0.9975
We humans like to know where we are
headed, but creativity demands that we travel paths that lead to who-knows-where.

2393. Probability: 0.9722
For example, one of our producers, John Walker, stays calm by imagining his very taxing
job as holding a giant upside-down pyramid in his palm by its pointy tip.

2394. Probability: 0.9747
In this
dream, he was driving down a winding and precarious stretch of highway in a rickety old
station wagon, with no one else in the car.

2395. Probability: 0.9784
“But I was in the backseat!” he says.

2396. Probability: 0.9741
“For some reason, I still had a steering wheel, but my
visibility was terrible because of where I was sitting.

2397. Probability: 0.9590
Brad has told me that he thinks of directing the way he thinks about skiing.

2398. Probability: 0.9639
Just as George Lucas
liked to imagine his company as a wagon train headed west—its passengers full of purpose,
part of a team, unwavering in their pursuit of their destination—the coping mechanisms used
by Pixar and Disney Animation’s directors, producers, and writers draw heavily on
visualization.

2399. Probability: 0.9792
As Andrew says, continuing his nautical metaphor, “If you’re sailing across
the ocean and your goal is to avoid weather and waves, then why the hell are you sailing?”
he says.

2400. Probability: 0.9840
The trick is to use our skills and
knowledge not to duplicate but to invent.

2401. Probability: 0.9559
In talking to directors and writers, I’m constantly inspired by the models they keep in their
heads—each a unique mechanism they use to keep moving forward, through adversity, in
pursuit of their goals.

2402. Probability: 0.9908
And then you start to see a little light and then a little more light and then,
suddenly, you’re out in the bright sun.” For Pete, this metaphor is a way of making that
moment—the one in which you can’t see your own hand in front of your face and you aren’t
sure you’ll ever find your way out—a bit less frightening.

2403. Probability: 0.9912
Rich Moore, who directed Wreck-It Ralph for Disney Animation, envisions a slightly
different scenario.

2404. Probability: 0.9868
He imagines himself in a maze while he’s making a movie.

2405. Probability: 0.9936
Instead of
running through willy-nilly, frantically searching for his way out, he places the tips of his
fingers along one wall as he moves forward, slowing down here and there to assess and using
his sense of touch to help him remember the route he’s traveled so far.

2406. Probability: 0.9839
“I loved mazes as a kid,” Rich says.

2407. Probability: 0.9923
This adds yet another
element to the picture—the idea that as you progress, your project is revealing itself to you.

2408. Probability: 0.9742
“You’re digging away, and you don’t know what dinosaur you’re digging for,” Bob says.

2409. Probability: 0.9784
But they argue that the idea the movie is in there somewhere—think of
David, trapped in Michelangelo’s block of marble—helps them stay on track and not lose
hope.

2410. Probability: 0.9708
After all, you probably worked hard to dig each element up.

2411. Probability: 0.9519
“The
first trick,” he likes to say, “is to find the mountain.” In other words, you must feel your way,
letting the mountain reveal itself to you.

2412. Probability: 0.9735
And notably, he says, climbing a mountain doesn’t
necessarily mean ascending.

2413. Probability: 0.9795
I like a lot about this metaphor—except for its implication that the mountain exists.

2414. Probability: 0.9739
Like
Andrew’s archeological dig, it suggests that the artist must simply “find” the piece of art, or
the idea, that is hidden from sight.

2415. Probability: 0.9715
That requires charting the path from nothing to
something, and imagining himself as a blindfolded mountain climber serves him, he says,
because it girds him for the inevitable ups and downs of his job.

2416. Probability: 0.9962
This
makes sense for creative leaders who must guide so many people through the beats of a story
or the production of a film.

2417. Probability: 0.9820
At the beginning, the director’s or writer’s destination is unclear,
but he or she must forge ahead anyway.

2418. Probability: 0.9699
Remember John Walker’s upside-down pyramid?

2419. Probability: 0.9904
Lindsey Collins, a producer who has worked with Andrew on several films, imagines herself
as a chameleon who can change her colors depending on which constituency she’s dealing
with.

2420. Probability: 0.9818
Adapting to your
environment, like a lizard that blends into whatever background it finds itself in, is Lindsey’s
way of managing the competing—and potentially crazy-making—forces she encounters in her
job.

2421. Probability: 0.9550
“I’m a firm believer in the chaotic nature of the creative process needing to be chaotic.

2422. Probability: 0.9903
Lindsey jokes that she employs “the Columbo
effect”—a reference to Peter Falk’s iconic TV detective, who appeared to bumble his way
through a case, even as he inevitably zeroed in on the culprit.

2423. Probability: 0.9778
When mediating between two
groups who aren’t communicating well, for example, Lindsey feigns confusion.

2424. Probability: 0.9773
They reach out, they
listen, they wrangle, coax, and cajole.

2425. Probability: 0.9564
And somewhere in the middle of the flock, there is going to be a
bunch of stuff going on that I can’t even see.

2426. Probability: 0.9623
I’ve always been intrigued, for example, by the way that many people use the analogy of a
train to describe their companies.

2427. Probability: 0.9787
I am constantly rethinking my own models for how to deal with uncertainty and change and
how to enable people.

2428. Probability: 0.9795
At Lucasfilm, I had the image of riding bareback on a herd of wild
horses, some of them faster than others, trying to keep steady.

2429. Probability: 0.9875
Other times, I’ve imagined my
feet on either side of one of those balance boards that moves atop a cylindrical roller.

2430. Probability: 0.9865
Over time, with new experiences, my model has continued to evolve—
and is still evolving, even as I write this book.

2431. Probability: 0.9769
Several summers ago my wife, Susan, gave me a gift that led to this insight.

2432. Probability: 0.9758
Sensing that I
needed a break, she arranged for me to attend a silent meditation retreat at the Shambhala
Mountain Center in Red Feather Lakes, Colorado.

2433. Probability: 0.9756
The search for a
clear mind is one of the fundamental goals of creative people, but the route each one of us
travels to get there is unmarked.

2434. Probability: 0.9834
And for a while, at least, this behavior can even yield good
results.

2435. Probability: 0.9512
The models
in our heads embolden us as we whistle through the dark.

2436. Probability: 0.9900
To say that John and I were surprised
doesn’t really begin to capture it.

2437. Probability: 0.9542
And
one of Bob’s first acts as CEO had been to reach out to Steve in an effort to mend fences.

2438. Probability: 0.9733
They’d then struck a deal to make the top shows on ABC available on iTunes, and largely
because of this, Steve trusted Bob.

2439. Probability: 0.9775
The iTunes deal took about ten days to
complete; Iger didn’t let entrenched forces get in the way.

2440. Probability: 0.9806
As John and I sat there, trying to get our heads around a merger, Steve began pacing
around his living room, laying out the reasons that it made sense.

2441. Probability: 0.9630
Number two, Steve felt that a
merger would help Pixar have more of a creative impact by allowing it to play on a bigger,
sturdier stage.

2442. Probability: 0.9826
“Right now, Pixar is a yacht,” he said.

2443. Probability: 0.9615
“But a merger will put us on a giant
ocean liner, where big waves and poor weather won’t affect us as much.

2444. Probability: 0.9895
But Walt Disney Company’s
acquisition of Pixar Animation Studios for $7.4 billion was not your typical merger.

2445. Probability: 0.9703
He proposed that John and I be put in charge of both Pixar and Disney
Animation—I’d be president and John chief creative officer—because he thought, and Bob
agreed, that if the leadership of the two studios were separate, an unhealthy competition
would emerge that would eventually drag both studios down.

2446. Probability: 0.9796
John has always thought of Pixar as a studio full of pioneers who pride themselves on
having invented a new art form while always aspiring to the highest level of storytelling.

2447. Probability: 0.9841
Disney Animation, by contrast, is a studio with a grand heritage.

2448. Probability: 0.9674
It’s the gold standard of
animation excellence; its employees yearn to make movies that are worthy of Walt—as good
as those he made but resonant in our time.

2449. Probability: 0.9871
To be honest, John and I had no idea whether our
theories about how to manage creative people would hold up there.

2450. Probability: 0.9721
Pixar’s joining with Disney was our chance to prove—to ourselves, if not anyone else—that
what we’d created at Pixar could work outside of Pixar.

2451. Probability: 0.9757
Both the run-up to the acquisition
and its execution provided the ultimate case study, and as such, it was enormously exciting to
be a part of.

2452. Probability: 0.9684
We met for dinner near the Disney Studios in Burbank, and I liked him immediately.

2453. Probability: 0.9776
The
first thing he did was tell me a story: A month earlier, at the opening of Hong Kong
Disneyland, he’d had an epiphany.

2454. Probability: 0.9537
It happened as he was watching a parade of characters
trooping by: Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Ariel … and Buzz Lightyear and
Woody.

2455. Probability: 0.9623
“It occurred to me that the only classic characters that had been created in the past
ten years were Pixar characters,” Bob said.

2456. Probability: 0.9649
Something unusual had been built at
Pixar, he said, and he wanted to understand it.

2457. Probability: 0.9524
His agenda was clear: reviving
Disney Animation while also preserving Pixar’s autonomy.

2458. Probability: 0.9562
Could Pixar
and Disney Animation flourish independent of one another, separate but equal?

2459. Probability: 0.9785
As we discussed the challenges of the merger, Steve
told a story.

2460. Probability: 0.9712
The future of Pixar, of Disney, and of
animation itself would be brighter if we joined forces.

2461. Probability: 0.9691
(Number 11, for example, stated that Pixar employees must remain free
to exercise their creative freedom with their titles and names on their business cards; number
33 ensured that Pixar’s people could continue to exert “personal cube/office/space decorating
to reflect person’s individuality.”) Some sought to preserve popular company rituals.

2462. Probability: 0.9745
We welcomed Bob onto the stage then, and our people greeted him with a warmth that
made me proud.

2463. Probability: 0.9942
That’s Pixar.

2464. Probability: 0.9752
He had succeeded in
providing Pixar, the company he’d helped turn from a struggling hardware supplier into an
animation powerhouse, with the two things it needed to endure: a worthy corporate partner
in Disney and, in Bob, a genuine advocate.

2465. Probability: 0.9503
I was eager to turn the microphone over to John, the kindred spirit whom so many of the
artists in the room already revered.

2466. Probability: 0.9517
I sensed that John’s presence would reassure them about
the transition, and I was right.

2467. Probability: 0.9831
He talked about what it meant to be a
director-driven animation company that made movies that sprung from people’s hearts and
connected in a real way with audiences.

2468. Probability: 0.9679
I wanted
to walk the halls before anyone else got there—just to get the lay of the land.

2469. Probability: 0.9776
At Pixar,
people’s work areas are virtual shrines to individuality—decorated, adorned, modified in
ways that express the quirks and passions of the person who occupies that space.

2470. Probability: 0.9912
Upstairs on the
top floor, the “executive suite” was set off by an imposing portal that discouraged entry—
creating a sort of gated community kind of vibe.

2471. Probability: 0.9949
First,
we turned the off-putting executive suite on the top floor into two spacious story rooms
where filmmakers could gather to brainstorm about their films.

2472. Probability: 0.9816
John and I put our offices on
the second floor, right in the middle of things, and removed the secretarial cubicles that had
functioned as a sort of obstacle to access (instead, most secretaries got their own offices).

2473. Probability: 0.9616
John and I made a point of leaving the shades on our office windows open so that people
could see us and we could see them.

2474. Probability: 0.9947
Instead of a portal separating “us” from “them,” we installed a
carpet whose brightly colored panels, like lanes of a road, guided people toward our offices,
not away from them.

2475. Probability: 0.9927
We ripped out several walls to create a central gathering place right
outside our doors, complete with a new coffee and snack bar.

2476. Probability: 0.9625
These may sound like symbolic or even superficial touches, but the messages they sent set
the stage for some major organizational changes.

2477. Probability: 0.9561
Nonetheless, we moved forward with a strategy.

2478. Probability: 0.9607
We needed to create a version of the Braintrust and teach the studio’s people how to work
within it.

2479. Probability: 0.9604
One top executive at Disney got my attention right away by telling me that he didn’t know
why Disney had bought Pixar in the first place.

2480. Probability: 0.9828
Apparently a lover of sports analogies, he told
me that Disney Animation was on the one-yard line, ready to score.

2481. Probability: 0.9795
This was someone I could work with.

2482. Probability: 0.9652
Another lucky break for us was that our head of human resources at Disney Animation was
Ann Le Cam.

2483. Probability: 0.9904
Even though she was steeped in the old ways of doing things, Ann had an
intellectual curiosity and a willingness to remake the Animation Studio in a different image.

2484. Probability: 0.9766
To show her what I wanted, I drew a
pyramid on a piece of paper.

2485. Probability: 0.9556
2) represented where we might be in three more (and you’ll note that it
didn’t stay within the boundaries of Ann’s two-year plan).

2486. Probability: 0.9894
Instead of setting forth a “perfect” route to achieving future goals (and sticking to
it unwaveringly), I wanted Ann to be open to readjusting along the way, to remaining
flexible, to accepting that we would be making it up as we go.

2487. Probability: 0.9733
Not only did she intuitively
grasp what I was talking about, she also soon undertook a painful reorganization of her own
group to align it with the new way of thinking.

2488. Probability: 0.9658
Afterward, one of the
Disney directors confided to me that many people in the room had major reservations about
the film but didn’t say what they thought because John had kicked things off so positively.

2489. Probability: 0.9540
But I can say that
today, Disney’s Story Trust is made up of individuals who understand not only that they must
do the difficult work of leveling with one another but how to do it better.

2490. Probability: 0.9829
I mentioned earlier that we switched directors on this film midstream—bringing in Brad
Bird, fresh off The Incredibles, who came in and reworked the story in ways that required a
serious technical reboot.

2491. Probability: 0.9833
Specifically, while in the earlier version all the rats had walked on
two feet, Brad felt strongly that (with the exception of Remy, our hero) they should walk on
four—like real rats.

2492. Probability: 0.9753
The producer said that they couldn’t finish the film by the deadline unless they
could borrow some people from Disney, which was in a lull between projects, to help out.

2493. Probability: 0.9913
But in the end, the Ratatouille team figured out how to make
the film, on time, with what they had.

2494. Probability: 0.9549
We asked
Chris Williams, a veteran story artist best known for Mulan and The Emperor’s New Groove,
and Byron Howard, then a supervising animator on Lilo and Stitch, to step in as its directors.

2495. Probability: 0.9853
Immediately, they began reconceiving the movie.

2496. Probability: 0.9751
The serial killer was tossed, and the movie
was renamed Bolt.

2497. Probability: 0.9824
Chris later told me that to be at the helm of a production whose crew showed this kind of
commitment, under such pressure, was energizing.

2498. Probability: 0.9824
“It was amazing to find myself in the
middle of this thing that was so galvanizing for the whole studio,” he recalled.

2499. Probability: 0.9863
Very late in the game, problems arose around Rhino the Hamster, our hero’s trusty—if
deluded—sidekick and the funniest character in the movie.

2500. Probability: 0.9931
The rebooted script required Rhino to be able to walk on
two legs, but he’d originally been designed to walk on four.

2501. Probability: 0.9686
Innovation
would, and we knew they had it in them.

2502. Probability: 0.9830
With the best
intentions, the film’s production managers had responded to the crisis with a timetable that
would ensure a character that was fully functional with no errors.

2503. Probability: 0.9912
It
was nothing short of exhilarating to see it come back, full force, on Bolt.

2504. Probability: 0.9964
Chris and Byron and
their creative team were open and responsive and, most important, able to move the focus
away from the notion of the “right” way to fix the problem to actually fixing the problem—a
subtle but important distinction.

2505. Probability: 0.9970
By pulling together,
they’d turned a humdrum, stalled project into a compelling one—and in record time.

2506. Probability: 0.9846
At a creative company, mistaking one for the other can be
fatal—but getting it right always elevates.

2507. Probability: 0.9656
One Pixar
manager likened the situation to the aftermath of a divorce, when your parents remarry and
adopt the kids of their new spouses.

2508. Probability: 0.9735
Namely, it was an opportunity for other Pixar managers to step forward.

2509. Probability: 0.9713
This corporate détente, if you will,
wouldn’t have been possible, I think, without the Five Year Compact.

2510. Probability: 0.9680
This fosters a sense of personal ownership and pride in the company that, to my mind,
benefits the larger enterprise.

2511. Probability: 0.9929
Right off, they proposed a twist on a classic fairy tale—The Frog Prince—which would
take place in New Orleans and feature, as its heroine, Disney’s first-ever African-American
princess.

2512. Probability: 0.9570
We green-lighted The Princess and the Frog and began reassembling a crew that had
been dispersed to the winds.

2513. Probability: 0.9878
The third
scenario, however, felt just right—a combination of hiring key talent inside the studio while
outsourcing certain parts of the process that wouldn’t affect quality.

2514. Probability: 0.9811
John and I were excited.

2515. Probability: 0.9852
Not only were we reviving the art form that the studio was built
upon, this was the first movie at Disney that would be made, start to finish, on our watch.

2516. Probability: 0.9584
It was as if everyone working on The Princess and the
Frog felt that they had something to prove.

2517. Probability: 0.9652
Research trips, for example.

2518. Probability: 0.9896
Frankly, it took a while to get the Disney folks on
board with this idea.

2519. Probability: 0.9900
So during the prepping of The Princess and the Frog,
the entire creative leadership of the film headed to Louisiana.

2520. Probability: 0.9847
Attending the Krewe of
Bacchus parade on the Sunday before Mardi Gras gave them a vivid frame of reference when
they animated a sequence based on that festival; their ride on the riverboat Natchez helped
them block out a scene set on a similar river-going vessel; a tour of the St.

2521. Probability: 0.9875
Upon their return, the directors, Ron
and John, each told me that research inspired the production in ways they never expected.

2522. Probability: 0.9605
Turns out, it was our own version of a stupid pill.

2523. Probability: 0.9946
The
quality of its animation rivaled the best ever done by the studio.

2524. Probability: 0.9974
I’d liked the idea of celebrating, right out of the box, the art form that Walt
Disney himself pioneered.

2525. Probability: 0.9941
Disney Animation’s embrace of the new would take on steam, ironically, when it finally
figured out how to reframe and rethink something old: the fairy tale Rapunzel.

2526. Probability: 0.9889
But now, the studio was becoming creatively
healthier, and people were talking to one another.

2527. Probability: 0.9622
For years, many at Disney had tried (and failed) to crack the story of Rapunzel—she of the
famous mane of hair—in a way that seemed destined to make a terrific movie.

2528. Probability: 0.9630
At
one point, Michael Eisner himself had proposed updating the tale, calling it Rapunzel
Unbraided, and setting it in modern-day San Francisco.

2529. Probability: 0.9747
Then, somehow, our heroine would be
transported into the fairy tale world.

2530. Probability: 0.9667
One of our first acts at Disney was to ask Glen to keep Rapunzel going.

2531. Probability: 0.9976
They took the story in a different direction,
teaming up with the writer Dan Fogelman and the composer Alan Menken, who had done the
music for the iconic Disney musicals of the 1990s.

2532. Probability: 0.9889
This Rapunzel was more assertive than the
character in the classic tale, and her hair had magical healing powers, which she could
activate by singing an incantation.

2533. Probability: 0.9981
This version of the story was familiar but sassy and
modern at the same time.

2534. Probability: 0.9709
“You wouldn’t call Toy Story ‘Buzz Lightyear,’ ” as Nathan said.

2535. Probability: 0.9986
Released in November 2010, Tangled was a runaway success, artistically and commercially.

2536. Probability: 0.9532
The studio had its first number one hit in
sixteen years, and the reverberations within the building were palpable.

2537. Probability: 0.9912
It involved John’s and my determination to use the success of Tangled as a
healing moment for the studio, and we felt like we knew just how to do it.

2538. Probability: 0.9812
We had learned long ago that while everyone appreciates cash bonuses, they value
something else almost as much: being looked in the eye by someone they respect and told,
“Thank you.” At Pixar, we’d devised a way to give our employees money and gratitude.

2539. Probability: 0.9810
This
jibes with our belief that each film belongs to everyone at the studio (and is related to our
“ideas can come from anywhere” credo; everyone is encouraged to give notes and pitch in,
and they do).

2540. Probability: 0.9795
In the wake of Tangled’s success, I asked Ann Le Cam, our vice president of human
resources, to help us do something along the same lines at Disney.

2541. Probability: 0.9808
She printed up
personalized letters for each crew member explaining the reason for the bonus, and on a
weekday morning in the spring of 2010, Disney Animation’s general manager Andrew
Millstein, the directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, the previous director (and
inspiration for the movie) Glen Keane, the producer Roy Conli, and John and I asked
everyone who’d worked on Tangled to gather in one of the large stages at Disney.

2542. Probability: 0.9787
As they
milled about, they didn’t know what was coming—we’d suggested to them that it was a
general meeting.

2543. Probability: 0.9971
It was Ann’s idea to give each crew member a hot-off-the-presses DVD of the movie as
well—a small gesture that made our gratitude feel even more genuine.

2544. Probability: 0.9776
Yes.

2545. Probability: 0.9770
The ship was beginning to turn—and it would only keep turning.

2546. Probability: 0.9589
I was enormously gratified, then, as the studio was making Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen
(directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, who also wrote the script), when I noticed
something changing from within.

2547. Probability: 0.9937
This feedback group had become as good as Pixar’s Braintrust, but
with its own personality.

2548. Probability: 0.9839
We
had applied our principles to a dysfunctional group and had changed them, unleashing their
creative potential.

2549. Probability: 0.9521
They had become a cohesive team, stocked with standout talents.

2550. Probability: 0.9960
This
brought Disney Animation to a new level.

2551. Probability: 0.9872
Now we had a creative roster that was as good as
the one at Pixar, yet quite different.

2552. Probability: 0.9733
The studio Walt Disney had built had become worthy of
him once again.

2553. Probability: 0.9627
In part, that’s
because while I was writing this book, I was also working full-time at Disney and Pixar, and
the world did not stand still.

2554. Probability: 0.9750
The creative culture at Disney Animation, I believe,
is fundamentally different than when John and I arrived in 2006.

2555. Probability: 0.9593
As all this was taking place, Pixar released Monsters University, which you may remember
underwent a change of directors during its journey to the multiplex.

2556. Probability: 0.9812
The mood inside Pixar was jubilant.

2557. Probability: 0.9907
We called it Notes Day, and I see it as a stellar example of how to set the table for
creativity.

2558. Probability: 0.9889
Managers of creative companies must never forget to ask themselves: “How do we
tap the brainpower of our people?” From its genesis to its execution, from the goodwill it
engendered to the company-wide changes it set in motion, Notes Day was a success in part
because it was based on the idea that fixing things is an ongoing, incremental process.

2559. Probability: 0.9763
Creative people must accept that challenges never cease, failure can’t be avoided, and
“vision” is often an illusion.

2560. Probability: 0.9869
Notes Day was a reminder that collaboration, determination, and candor never fail to lift us
up.

2561. Probability: 0.9506
I am often asked which Pixar movie makes me the proudest.

2562. Probability: 0.9875
And it was this protective and
participatory spirit that led to Notes Day.

2563. Probability: 0.9706
At the same time, we did not want to stop taking risks.

2564. Probability: 0.9806
We wanted always to be a
company that would gamble on unusual films such as Up, Ratatouille, and WALL-E.

2565. Probability: 0.9637
“There’s a lightness and a speed at Disney that I want to see more of at Pixar,” John
said.

2566. Probability: 0.9562
When Guido had the floor, he told a story about something he’d instituted in his
department called “personal project days.” Two days a month, he allowed his engineers to
work on anything they wanted, using Pixar’s resources to engage with whatever problem or
question they found interesting.

2567. Probability: 0.9690
“You just give people the time, and they come up with the ideas,” Guido told us.

2568. Probability: 0.9834
“That’s
the beauty of it: It comes from them.”
Guido had already told me about how, in just four months, personal project days had
reenergized his staff.

2569. Probability: 0.9776
Privately, we’d even begun to brainstorm ideas about how similar efforts
could be implemented company-wide.

2570. Probability: 0.9960
The idea wasn’t
practical, in the end, but it was thought-provoking.

2571. Probability: 0.9879
“Let’s ask Pixar’s people—all of them—for ideas about how to do it,” he said.

2572. Probability: 0.9979
“Okay, now that’s interesting,” he said.

2573. Probability: 0.9872
“What if we closed Pixar for the day?

2574. Probability: 0.9985
“This is so Pixar,” Andrew said.

2575. Probability: 0.9908
“Totally unexpected.

2576. Probability: 0.9800
Yes!

2577. Probability: 0.9576
You want people to get excited?

2578. Probability: 0.9518
I believe that no creative company should ever stop evolving, and this would be our latest
attempt to avoid stagnation.

2579. Probability: 0.9728
So it made sense, as we began to make Guido’s idea a reality, to
invoke our shorthand term for candid feedback: notes.

2580. Probability: 0.9761
At some point, we decided that
Monday, March 11, 2013, would be called “Notes Day.”
The exercise would be fruitless without the buy-in of our people, so we scheduled three
town hall–style meetings to explain the idea to more than 300 employees at a time.

2581. Probability: 0.9795
First, it created an electronic suggestion box where Pixar people could submit discussion
topics they thought would help us become more innovative and more efficient.

2582. Probability: 0.9693
Immediately,
topic ideas began flooding in, along with suggestions about how to run Notes Day itself.

2583. Probability: 0.9959
The suggestion box, in turn, prompted something that none of us had expected.

2584. Probability: 0.9814
Many
departments, without any prodding, created their own wiki pages and blogs to hash out what
they believed the core issues at Pixar really were.

2585. Probability: 0.9784
Weeks before Notes Day, people were
talking among themselves in ways they hadn’t before about how, specifically, to improve
workflow and enact positive change.

2586. Probability: 0.9630
When people asked for guidance on how to be involved,
Tom nudged them along, sending this hypothetical prompt to anyone who asked: “The year is
2017.

2587. Probability: 0.9640
Both of this year’s films were completed in well under 18,500 person-weeks.… What
innovations helped these productions meet their budget goals?

2588. Probability: 0.9769
“Eighteen Five, Smaiteen Five,” said the header on one email received by the Notes Day
Working Group.

2589. Probability: 0.9570
What, this writer asked, if of the three films Pixar made every two years, one
of them was produced for a “reduced scope” of 15,000 person-weeks?

2590. Probability: 0.9835
What would be different about the process?” The subject line for that
email, by the way, was “GET RADICAL.”
Once the whittling process was complete, Tom needed to find out roughly how many
people were interested in each discussion topic so that he could plan the day accordingly.

2591. Probability: 0.9887
The problem of doing more with less was interesting to them, and they
wanted to engage with it.

2592. Probability: 0.9681
(Think about that—the topic that captured my Pixar colleagues’
imagination more than any other was an attempt to be even more aggressive in trying to
reduce the budget!

2593. Probability: 0.9542
Build in scope discussions in the idea-generation phase.

2594. Probability: 0.9706
Then, in a space marked “Revised Proposal?” this form
encouraged participants to improve on the stated approach.

2595. Probability: 0.9670
The
following Monday, we would discuss 106 topics in 171 sessions managed by 138 facilitators
in 66 meeting spaces across our three buildings—from offices to conference rooms to
common spaces like the Poodle Lounge, which has a painting of George Washington on the
wall, a bean bag toss game on the floor, and a disco ball hanging overhead.

2596. Probability: 0.9627
We were as ready as we were ever going to be to let this experiment unfold.

2597. Probability: 0.9707
If the
A.M
navy blue Pixar sweatshirt I was wearing didn’t make it obvious enough, the look on my face
gave it away: I was enormously proud of how our people had already shown their
commitment to making Notes Day a historic day for us.

2598. Probability: 0.9538
John often plays the role of inspirer-in-chief, and the people at Disney and Pixar alike rely
on his energy and optimism.

2599. Probability: 0.9950
I’m not kidding.

2600. Probability: 0.9690
This is going to
fundamentally change the company for the better.

2601. Probability: 0.9716
How did we accomplish that?—you would have found Pixar’s executive chef, a woman who
worked in Legal, a woman from Finance, a veteran animator, a man from Systems, and more
than a dozen others.

2602. Probability: 0.9815
“A great job.

2603. Probability: 0.9722
The Systems guy told a story about answering a frantic call for
tech support.

2604. Probability: 0.9617
“We need to heighten people’s awareness of what they do not
know.”
Among the ideas this group put on their exit forms: fostering more empathy between
departments through a job-swapping program, establishing a lunch lottery that would match
people at random to encourage new connections and friendships, and holding cross-
departmental mixers designed to let far-flung colleagues get to know each other over a few
beers.

2605. Probability: 0.9566
They were beaming.

2606. Probability: 0.9564
At day’s end, as the entire company gathered outside
for beer, hot dogs, and some instant analysis, I noticed people from different departments
continuing the discussions they’d begun inside.

2607. Probability: 0.9725
The energy on the whole campus was electric.

2608. Probability: 0.9941
This was the Pixar that they wanted, that we wanted.

2609. Probability: 0.9651
“23.”
And then there was this: “Notes Day is the proof that Pixar cares about people as much as
about finances.” And: “Do this again next year.”
The next morning, I received emails from hundreds of employees.

2610. Probability: 0.9931
One, from a storyboard
artist, perfectly captured the feeling expressed by many.

2611. Probability: 0.9622
“Hello Ed,” it read.

2612. Probability: 0.9508
“I just wanted to
say a post–Notes Day thank you.

2613. Probability: 0.9729
The day was truly amazing, inspirational, informative and as
I heard many times throughout the day, from many people, cathartic.

2614. Probability: 0.9720
In the end, I think we all
walked away with a sense of ownership over this amazing place, and its future.

2615. Probability: 0.9629
A ‘we’re all in
this together’ feel.

2616. Probability: 0.9681
If nothing else, this is a huge victory.

2617. Probability: 0.9881
John’s openness, and courage to
speak about his feedback, set an unbelievable bar.

2618. Probability: 0.9912
The ideas that emerged on Notes Day, in other words, were not gathering dust in a drawer.

2619. Probability: 0.9975
They were changing Pixar—meaningfully and for the better.

2620. Probability: 0.9504
What made Notes Day work?

2621. Probability: 0.9565
It provided a
framework—and it kept us from falling into confusion.

2622. Probability: 0.9849
Second, this was an idea championed by those at the highest levels of the company.

2623. Probability: 0.9770
But that our own people made
Notes Day happen was, I believe, key to its success.

2624. Probability: 0.9886
Not only did they drive the discussion in
meaningful ways, but their involvement also paid its own dividends.

2625. Probability: 0.9890
Seeing themselves
engage and cooperate, steering the agenda toward something that could make a real
difference, they remembered why they worked at Pixar.

2626. Probability: 0.9877
Notes Day wasn’t an end point but a beginning—a way of making room for our employees to
step forward and think about their role in our company’s future.

2627. Probability: 0.9973
But it shifted our culture—repaired it, even—in ways that
will make us better as we go forward.

2628. Probability: 0.9918
I’m reminded
here of a letter written by one of our animators, Austin Madison, which I found particularly
uplifting.

2629. Probability: 0.9613
“To Whom it May Inspire,” Austin wrote.

2630. Probability: 0.9746
“I, like many of you artists out there, constantly
shift between two states.

2631. Probability: 0.9972
The first (and far more preferable of the two) is white-hot, ‘in the
zone’ seat-of-the-pants, firing on all cylinders creative mode.

2632. Probability: 0.9926
This is when you lay your pen
down and the ideas pour out like wine from a royal chalice!

2633. Probability: 0.9530
PERSIST on staying true to your vision.… ”
I couldn’t have put it any better.

2634. Probability: 0.9847
How we persist.

2635. Probability: 0.9530
To keep a creative culture
vibrant, we must not be afraid of constant uncertainty.

2636. Probability: 0.9939
And that’s the fun part.

2637. Probability: 0.9717
Then Steve Jobs swooped in.

2638. Probability: 0.9809
As I related earlier, it was around this time
that one of his attorneys pulled us aside during a meeting and jokingly—I think—said that we
were about to climb aboard the Steve Jobs roller coaster.

2639. Probability: 0.9669
Get on, we did, and what a ride it
would prove to be—with all of the attendant ups and downs.

2640. Probability: 0.9797
The word genius is used a lot these days—too much, I think—but with Steve, I actually
think it was warranted.

2641. Probability: 0.9803
This is the part of Steve that people love to write about.

2642. Probability: 0.9923
And I think Pixar played a role in that development.

2643. Probability: 0.9599
Remember, in the late 1980s, when Pixar was founded, Steve was spending most of his
time building NeXT, the computer company he’d started after being forced out of Apple.

2644. Probability: 0.9718
The huge
dollar amount, combined with the fact that Steve didn’t give IBM rights to subsequent
versions of the software, seemed like a home run deal for NeXT.

2645. Probability: 0.9718
He had an expensive group that was ahead of its time.

2646. Probability: 0.9520
He respected our determination to be the first
to make a computer-animated feature film.

2647. Probability: 0.9711
I remember being struck by Steve’s response to passion when we were working on our
second film, A Bug’s Life.

2648. Probability: 0.9623
The production designer on the film, Bill Cone, was
showing some images on monitors that happened to be in widescreen format.

2649. Probability: 0.9853
Bill, to his credit, came right back at him, explaining why the widescreen
format was absolutely crucial from an artistic standpoint.

2650. Probability: 0.9707
The fact that Bill was willing to stand up so forcefully and articulately for what he
believed showed Steve that Bill’s ideas were worthy of respect.

2651. Probability: 0.9885
Steve threw himself
into designing it, and the magnificent main building that we occupy today is the outgrowth of
all that work.

2652. Probability: 0.9590
But it didn’t come easily.

2653. Probability: 0.9912
Steve’s first pass at a design was based on some peculiar ideas he had about how to force
interaction among people.

2654. Probability: 0.9909
Next, he envisioned a separate building for each movie under production—the idea being
that each crew would benefit from having its own contained space, free of distraction.

2655. Probability: 0.9640
I
wasn’t so sure about that, so I asked him to go on a road trip.

2656. Probability: 0.9928
I loved that bit of history—and the fact that the name Skunk Works itself had been
borrowed from Al Capp’s newspaper comic strip Li’l Abner.

2657. Probability: 0.9890
In that strip, there was a running
joke about a mysterious and malodorous place deep in the forest called the “Skonk Works”
where a strong beverage was brewed from skunks, old shoes, and other strange ingredients.

2658. Probability: 0.9749
I liked the feel of the wide-open
hallways.

2659. Probability: 0.9738
He saw firsthand the way that the Disney
people took advantage of the open floor plan, sharing information and brainstorming.

2660. Probability: 0.9843
He took the creation of a new Pixar headquarters as a personal responsibility.

2661. Probability: 0.9884
But
Steve did, taking that principle and building our headquarters around it.

2662. Probability: 0.9672
Everything about the
place was designed to encourage people to mingle, meet, and communicate, to support our
filmmaking by enhancing our ability to work together.

2663. Probability: 0.9788
He didn’t want perceived barriers, so the stairs were open and inviting.

2664. Probability: 0.9619
He wanted a
single entrance to the building so that we saw each other as we entered.

2665. Probability: 0.9821
Steve had thought all this through with the metalogic of a philosopher and the
meticulousness of a craftsman.

2666. Probability: 0.9945
From the day we moved in, on Thanksgiving weekend
of 2000, the building became an extraordinary and fertile home.

2667. Probability: 0.9783
Moreover, in our employees’
minds, it transformed Steve—always our external defender—into an integral part of our
internal culture.

2668. Probability: 0.9713
The Incredibles, he was implying, had to
reach higher.

2669. Probability: 0.9897
This is a rare skill, one
that Steve had too.

2670. Probability: 0.9766
When
Steve saw Pixar’s directors do the same, he recognized them as kindred spirits.

2671. Probability: 0.9794
Countless times, I remember watching him
toss ideas—pretty far-out ideas—into the air, just to see how they played.

2672. Probability: 0.9931
This is, in effect, a form of storytelling—searching for the best
way to frame and communicate an idea.

2673. Probability: 0.9798
This was a skill he used in his presentations at Apple.

2674. Probability: 0.9784
When he got up in front of an audience
to introduce a new product, he understood that he would communicate more effectively if he
put forward a narrative, and anyone who ever saw him do it could tell you that he gave
extraordinary and carefully crafted performances.

2675. Probability: 0.9896
There was
something about applying his intellect to the emotion of a film—Was it landing?

2676. Probability: 0.9737
But in fact,
over time, he became quite skilled at it.

2677. Probability: 0.9968
It had a touch screen that engaged the user,
making navigation not just easy but fun.

2678. Probability: 0.9755
He was particularly jazzed about it,
he said, because it was his goal not just to create a phone people used but to design a phone
people loved—one that made their lives better, both functionally and aesthetically.

2679. Probability: 0.9734

thought Apple had succeeded in creating such a device.

2680. Probability: 0.9564
In the end, he would achieve all three of his goals.

2681. Probability: 0.9777
His experience with Pixar was part of this change.

2682. Probability: 0.9668
Pixar movies, on the other hand, would live forever.

2683. Probability: 0.9831
He believed, as I do, that
because they dig for deeper truths, our movies will endure, and he found beauty in that idea.

2684. Probability: 0.9519
Later, he became our protector—a constructive critic internally but our fiercest
defender to the outside.

2685. Probability: 0.9919
But there was something special about the time he spent with us—
enhanced, counterintuitively, by the fact that Pixar was his sideline.

2686. Probability: 0.9694
Once
or twice per movie, when a crisis loomed, he would inevitably come in and say something
that helped alter our perceptions and improve the film.

2687. Probability: 0.9822
Steve
focused on the problem itself, not the filmmakers, which made his critiques all the more
powerful.

2688. Probability: 0.9793
You couldn’t dismiss Steve.

2689. Probability: 0.9661
He
learned to read the room, demonstrating skills that, years earlier, I didn’t think he had.

2690. Probability: 0.9888
Steve’s
transformation was an active one.

2691. Probability: 0.9730
He continued to engage; he just changed the way he went
about it.

2692. Probability: 0.9883
A characteristic of creative people is that they imagine making
the impossible possible.

2693. Probability: 0.9854
That imagining—dreaming, noodling, audaciously rejecting what is
(for the moment) true—is the way we discover what is new or important.

2694. Probability: 0.9938
And that creativity, at its best, surprises us all.

2695. Probability: 0.9810
There is another, different meaning of reality distortion for me.

2696. Probability: 0.9847
But Steve did.

2697. Probability: 0.9511
It was Steve.

2698. Probability: 0.9672
Any other investor or venture
capitalist would have given up.” But not Steve.

2699. Probability: 0.9534
Andrew Stanton described Steve as
“the creative firewall.” With Steve around, the people of Pixar “were like free-range
chickens,” he said, getting a laugh.

2700. Probability: 0.9561
During a meeting one day years ago, Pete noticed that Steve had two small,
identical holes in one of the legs of his Levis 501s.

2701. Probability: 0.9858
As Pete was
trying—and failing—to imagine a reason for these symmetrical holes, Steve reached down to
pull up his socks by grabbing them through his pants—putting his fingers right where the
holes were!

2702. Probability: 0.9748
Either
way, it was a humanizing aspect to this larger-than-life guy.”
Brad Bird recalled that when he first started talking to Pixar about doing The Incredibles, he
wasn’t sure if he would take the offer: He was still considering staying with Warner Bros.,
which had released his earlier movie, The Iron Giant.

2703. Probability: 0.9623
“But it took me a month to get a
meeting with the administration of the studio I’d just made a movie for,” Brad said.

2704. Probability: 0.9544
“And in
the meantime, Steve knew the name of my wife, asked how my kids were by name—he did
his homework.

2706. Probability: 0.9682
“But as Pixar evolved into an animation studio, he started to look
at all the work that we were doing, and he was amazed.

2707. Probability: 0.9909
In a quiet voice, he announced that just as our resident a capella group had sung at
every Pixar wrap party in our company’s history, it would now sing for Steve, too.

2708. Probability: 0.9662
Standing
in the building that we all called “Steve’s movie,” I couldn’t help but think that he would
have loved this—a fitting wrap to the production that was Steve Jobs.

2709. Probability: 0.9710
It had been one hell of a trip.

Entrepreneurship.

2743. Probability: 0.9584
It’s the lifeblood of our global econ-
omy and a strategic priority for virtually every
CEO around the world.In fact,a recent IBM poll of fifteen hun-
dred CEOs identified creativity as the number-one “leadership
competency”ofthe future.1The power ofinnovative ideas to rev-
olutionize industries and generate wealth is evident from history:
Apple iPod outplays Sony Walkman, Starbucks’s beans and
atmosphere drown traditional coffee shops,Skype uses a strategy
of“free”to beat AT&T and British Telecom,eBay crushes classi-
fied ads,and Southwest Airlines flies under the radar ofAmerican
and Delta.In every case,the creative ideas ofinnovative entrepre-
neurs produced powerful competitive advantages and tremen-
dous wealth for the pioneering company.

2744. Probability: 0.9883
We built a survey based on our interviews that taps into the
discovery skills of innovative leaders: associating,questioning,
observing, networking, and experimenting.

2745. Probability: 0.9677
To answer these questions,we developed our own list ofinno-
vative companies based on current innovation prowess (and ex-
pectations offuture innovations).How did we do this?

For example, Jeff Bezos
personally excels at experimenting,so he helped create institu-

2752. Probability: 0.9823
The innovators developed the right skills—
questioning, observing, networking, and experimenting—that
produced an innovative venture or product, but the result was
not always a financial success.

2753. Probability: 0.9551
Others benefitted by being in
the right place at the right time to make a critical observation,
talk to a key person with particularly useful knowledge, or
serendipitously learn from an experiment.

2754. Probability: 0.9816
Perhaps for this reason, we
stand inawe ofvisionary entrepreneurs such as Apple’s Steve Jobs,
Amazon’s Jeff Bezos,and eBay’s Pierre Omidyar,and innovative
executives like P&G’s A.G.Lafley,Bain & Company’s Orit Gadiesh,
and eBay’s Meg Whitman.

2755. Probability: 0.9725
How do these people come up with
groundbreaking new ideas?

2756. Probability: 0.9699
Even you.So using the example ofJobs,let’s explore this ability to
think different.How did Jobs come up with some ofhis innovative
ideas in the past?

2757. Probability: 0.9989
Innovative Idea #1: Personal Computers
Should Be Quiet and Small
One of the key innovations in the Apple II, the computer that
launched Apple,came from Jobs’s decision that it should be quiet.

2758. Probability: 0.9502
So Jobs went on the hunt for someone who could design a new
power supply.

2759. Probability: 0.9831
Through his network of contacts, he found Rod
Holt,a forty-something,chain-smoking socialist from the Atari
crowd.3 Pushed by Jobs,Holt abandoned the fifty-year-old con-
ventional linear unit technology and created a switching power
supply that revolutionized the way power was delivered to elec-
tronics products.Jobs’s pursuit of quiet and Holt’s ability to de-
liver an innovative power supply that didn’t need a fan made the
Apple II the quietest and smallest personal computer ever made
(a smaller computer was possible because it didn’t need extra space
for the fan).

2760. Probability: 0.9694
Had Jobs never asked,“Why does a computer need a fan?”and
“How do we keep a computer cool without a fan?”the Apple com-
puter as we know it would not exist.

2761. Probability: 0.9965
Innovative Idea #2: The Macintosh User Interface,
Operating System, and Mouse
The seed for the Macintosh, with its revolutionary operating
system,was planted when Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979.Xerox,
the copier company, created the Palo Alto Research Center
(PARC),a research lab charged with designing the office of the
future.

2762. Probability: 0.9944
Jobs wrangled a visit to PARC in exchange for offering
Xerox an opportunity to invest in Apple.Xerox didn’t know how
to capitalize on the exciting things going on at PARC,but Jobs did.

2763. Probability: 0.9985
Innovative Idea #3: Desktop Publishing on the Mac
The Macintosh,with its LaserWriter printer,was the first computer
to bring desktop publishing to the masses.

2764. Probability: 0.9902
Jobs claims that the
“beautiful typography”available on the Macintosh would never
have been introduced ifhe hadn’t dropped in on a calligraphy class
at Reed College in Oregon.Says Jobs:
Reed College offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruc-
tion in the country.Throughout the campus every poster,
every label on every drawer,was beautifully hand-
calligraphed.Because I had dropped out and didn’t have
to take the normal classes,I decided to take a calligraphy
class to learn how to do this.I learned about serifand
sanseriftypefaces,about varying the amount ofspace
between different letter combinations,about what makes
great typography great.It was beautiful,historical,artisti-
cally subtle in a way that science can’t capture,and I
found it fascinating.None ofthis had even a hope ofany
practical application in my life.But ten years later,when
we were designing the first Macintosh computer,it all
came back to me.And we designed it all into the Mac.It

The DNA of Disruptive Innovators
was the first computer with beautiful typography.IfI had
never dropped in on that single course in college,the Mac
would have never had multiple typefaces or proportion-
ally spaced fonts.And since Windows just copied the Mac,
it’s likely that no personal computer would have them.5
What if Jobs hadn’t decided to drop in on the calligraphy classes
when he had dropped out ofcollege?

2765. Probability: 0.9901
So what do we learn from Jobs’s ability to think different?

2766. Probability: 0.9639
Well,
first we see that his innovative ideas didn’t spring fully formed
from his head,as ifthey were a gift from the Idea Fairy.When we
examine the origins ofthese ideas,we typically find thatthe cata-
lyst was:(1) a question that challenged the status quo,(2) an ob-
servation ofa technology,company,or customer,(3) an experience
or experiment where he was trying out something new,or (4) a
conversation with someone who alerted him to an important piece
ofknowledge or opportunity.In fact,by carefully examining Jobs’s
behaviorsand,specifically,how those behaviors brought in new di-
verse knowledge that triggered an innovative idea,we can trace his
innovative ideas to their source.

2767. Probability: 0.9737
It helps innovators
discover new directions by making connections across seem-
ingly unrelated questions,problems,or ideas.Innovative break-
throughs often happen at the intersection of diverse disciplines
and fields.Author Frans Johanssen described this phenomenon as
“the Medici effect,”referring to the creative explosion in Florence
when the Medici family brought together creators from a wide
range of disciplines—sculptors, scientist, poets, philosophers,
painters, and architects.

2768. Probability: 0.9945
As these individuals connected, they
created new ideas at the intersection of their respective fields,
thereby spawning theRenaissance,one ofthe most innovative eras
in history.Put simply,innovative thinkers connect fields,prob-
lems,or ideas that others find unrelated.

2769. Probability: 0.9590
The other four discovery skills trigger associational thinking
by helping innovators increase their stock ofbuilding-block ideas
from which innovative ideas spring.Specifically,innovators engage
the following behavioral skills more frequently:
Questioning.Innovators are consummate questioners who
show a passion for inquiry.Their queries frequently challenge
the status quo,just as Jobs did when he asked,“Why does a
computer need a fan?”They love to ask,“Ifwe tried this,
what would happen?”Innovators,like Jobs,ask questions
tounderstand how things really are today,why they are
thatway,and how they might be changed or disrupted.

2770. Probability: 0.9765
Had he never chatted with Kay,he would never have wound
up purchasing Pixar,and the world might never have thrilled
to wonderful animated films like Toy Story,WALL-E,and Up.

2771. Probability: 0.9814
And having the courage to innovate means that they are actively
looking for opportunities to change the world.

2772. Probability: 0.9522
During that week,you come up with ideas alone,just thinking
inyour room.By contrast,your twin (1) talks with ten people—
including an engineer, a musician, a stay-at-home dad, and a
designer—about the venture;(2) visits three innovative start-ups
to observe what they do; (3) samples five “new to the market”
products and takes them apart; (4) shows a prototype he’s built
to five people, and (5) asks “What if I tried this?” and “What
would make this not work?”at least ten times each day during
these networking,observing,and experimenting activities.Who
do you bet will come up with the more innovative (and usable)
idea?

2773. Probability: 0.9949
They each combined the discovery skills uniquely to
forge new insights.

2774. Probability: 0.9520
Or Jeff Bezos.

2775. Probability: 0.9818
Or any other fa-
mous business innovator.

2776. Probability: 0.9694
But that doesn’t mean you can’t learn
from these innovators.

2777. Probability: 0.9645
We’ve seen MBA students in our classes use
the observing, networking, and experimenting techniques to
generate entrepreneurial business ideas.

2778. Probability: 0.9941
One got the idea for
launching a company that uses bacteria to eat pollution from
networking with someone he met at a neighborhood barbeque.

2779. Probability: 0.9880
So he
launched a company that sells software that helps people learn
English by watching movies.

2780. Probability: 0.9693
The point is this: you don’t have to be Steve Jobs to
generate innovative ideas for your business.

2781. Probability: 0.9537
(We’ll say more about
these skills later in the chapter and in chapter 8,but for now we
need only note that they are critical for delivering results and
translating an innovative idea into reality.)
Many innovators realize that they are deficient in these critical
skills and,consequently,try to team up with others who possess
them.For example,eBay founder Omidyar quickly recognized the
need for execution skills,so he invited JeffSkoll,a Stanford MBA,
and Meg Whitman,a Harvard MBA,to join him.“JeffSkoll and I
had very complementary skills,”Omidyar told us.“I’d say I did
more of the creative work developing the product and solving
problems around the product,while Jeffwas involved in the more
analytical and practical side ofthings.He was the one who would
listen to an idea of mine and then say,‘Ok,let’s figure out how to
get this done.’”Skoll and Whitman professionalized the eBay Web
site,added fixed-price auctions,drove international expansion,de-
veloped new categories such as autos,and integrated important
capabilities such as PayPal.

2782. Probability: 0.9724
However, once innovative entrepreneurs come up with a
promising new business idea and then shape that idea into a
bona fide business opportunity,the company begins to grow and
then must pay attention to building the processes necessary to
scale the idea.

2783. Probability: 0.9546
I regularly ask questions that challenge the status quo.

2784. Probability: 0.9585
New ideas often come to me when I am directly observ-
ing how people interact with products and services.

2785. Probability: 0.9693
I often find solutions to problems by drawing on solu-
tions or ideas developed in other industries, fields, or
disciplines.

2786. Probability: 0.9884
I frequently experiment to create new ways of doing
things.

2787. Probability: 0.9893
I frequently ask “what if” questions that provoke explo-
ration of new possibilities and frontiers.

2788. Probability: 0.9858
I consistently create detailed plans to get work done.

2789. Probability: 0.9708
I
NNOVATORS THINK DIFFERENTLY(to be grammatically
correct),but as Steve Jobs put it,they really just think
different by connecting the unconnected.Einstein once called cre-
ative thinking “combinatorial play”and saw it as “the essential fea-
ture in productive thought.”Associating—or the ability to make
surprising connections across areas ofknowledge,industries,even
geographies—is an often-taken-for-granted skill among the inno-
vators we studied.Innovators actively pursue diverse new informa-
tion and ideas through questioning,observing,networking,and
experimenting—the key catalysts for creative associations.

2790. Probability: 0.9948
To illustrate how associations produce innovative business
ideas, consider how Marc Benioff came up with the idea for
Salesforce.com, now a $13 billion software company.

experience with technology and software began when, as a
fifteen-year-old, he built a small software company, Liberty
Software,writing computer games (like “How to Juggle”) on his
Commodore 64.As a computer science and entrepreneurship un-
dergraduate,Benioffworked summers at Apple during the build-
up and launch ofthe first Mac,learning firsthand what it meant to
work in a think-different world.

2792. Probability: 0.9725
Why are we still loading and upgrading soft-
ware the way that we have been doing all this time when we now
have the Internet?’And that was a fundamental breakthrough for
me,asking those questions.And that’s the genesis ofSalesforce.It’s
basically enterprise software meets Amazon.”
100092 02 041-064 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:57 AM Page 43

Associating
Benioff’s synthesis ofnovel inputs or association—“enterprise
software meets Amazon”—challenged the industry tradition of
selling software on CD-ROMs and engaging companies in lengthy,
customized (and expensive) installation processes,andinstead fo-
cused on delivering software as a service over the Internet.That
way,the software would be available 24/7,and companies would
avoid all the costs and shutdowns associated with ongoing,large-
scale IT system installations and upgrades.Given his substantial
experience in sales and marketing at Oracle,Beniofffelt that pro-
viding software services for managing a sales force and customer
relations carried huge potential for small and medium-sized busi-
nesses that couldn’t afford customized enterprise software.Thus,
Salesforce.com was born.

2793. Probability: 0.9747
Benioff’s vision emerged from years of significant software
industry experience combined with countless questions,observa-
tions,explorations,and conversations that ultimately helped him
bring together things that had never been connected before.He
borrowed elements ofthe Amazon business model and built a dif-
ferent one based on a software system that companies would pay
for asthey used it,instead ofpaying for all ofthe software systems
beforethey used them (as most software providers did).It was truly
revolutionary as it launched an era of “cloud computing” that
seems obvious now,but was far from obvious then.

2794. Probability: 0.9849
Ever the juggler with a mind hooked on “combinatorial play”
(or playing around with new associations),Benioff and his Sales-
force.com team have continued the innovation journey.

2795. Probability: 0.9575
He
explained that pre-Salesforce.com,his critical question was “Why
isn’t all enterprise software like Amazon?”but post-Salesforce.com,
a different question slowly took its place,“Why isn’t all enterprise
software (including Salesforce.com) like Facebook?”Benioffandhis
team hotly pursued the answer and invented Chatter,a new social
software application that has been referred to as “Facebook for busi-
nesses.”Chatter takes the best ofFacebook and Twitter and applies

“Employees now follow accounts,and updates are automatically
broadcast to them in real-time via Chatter,”Beniofftold us.“This
is the true power of Chatter—bringing to light the most impor-

Associating: What It Is
The great innovative entrepreneur Walt Disney once described his
role in the company he founded as creative catalyst.

2797. Probability: 0.9702
By that he
meant that while he himselfdidn’t actually do the drawings for the
wonderful animated films or build the giant Matterhorn replica
for Disneyland,he did put ideas together in ways that sparked cre-
ative insights throughout the company.One day,a little boy was
curious about Disney’s job,and Disney vividly recalled the con-
versation:“I was stumped one day when a little boy asked,‘Do you
draw Mickey Mouse?’ I had to admit I do not draw any more.

2798. Probability: 0.9808
‘Then you think up all the jokes and ideas?’‘No,’I said,‘I don’t do
that.’Finally,he looked at me and said,‘Mr.Disney,just what do
you do?’‘Well,’I said,‘I think of myself as a little bee.I go from

ney spark others’ideas,he sparked his own as well by putting him-
selfat the intersection ofothers’experiences.Over time,Disney’s
associational insights—including a string of industry firsts such
as joining animation with full-length movies andputting themes
into amusement parks—changed the face ofentertainment.

Associating: Where It Happens
Innovative ideas flourish at the intersection ofdiverse experience,
whether it be others’or our own.Throughout history,great ideas
have emerged from these crossroads of culture and experience.

2801. Probability: 0.9794
This Islamic renaissance produced significant
innovations,many ofwhich are relevant today,including the un-
derlying principles and ingredients oflipstick,suntan lotion,ther-
mometers, ethanol, underarm deodorant, tooth bleaching,
torpedoes,fireproofclothing,and charitable trusts.5
The Medici effect occurred in the Islamic and Italian renais-
sances,but it has also happened in modern times and in many
places around the world.For example,Silicon Valley in the 1960s
was anything but silicon.Yet,by the 1970s,all that had changed
and technology innovation flourished during its renaissance
decades of the 1970s,1980s,and 1990s.Elsewhere in the world,
countries and communities are actively attempting to create their
own intersections of people with expertise in different fields to
spark creative new ideas.China,for example,has bet substantial
resources on its innovation future to the extent that the rest of
the world believes that China is on track to become the world’s
most innovative country by 2020.In our work with the creative
industries and social innovation sectors in China (like so many
100092 02 041-064 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:57 AM Page 47

Associating
other sectors as well),we have found that they have dotted the land
with artistic and social innovation incubators where ideas see not
only the light ofday,but the light ofpractice also.

2802. Probability: 0.9572
A few of
our personal TED favorites are Sir Ken Robinson questioning
the foundation of educational systems, Kaki King experiment-
ing far beyond what a guitar was originally intended to do,and
David Gallo observing the incredible surprises of the deep sea
(including the unexpected talents of squids).TED’s underlying
beauty springs from the intentional diversity of participants and
presentations.This diversity forms the foundation for innovators
to potentially connect the unconnected.

2803. Probability: 0.9869
Innovators in our research not only frequented places like TED,
but literally constructed a TED in their heads through an
intentional depth and diversity of life experience, creating a
personalMedici effect.For them,TED-like conferences were icing
on a cake that they had already baked by actively questioning,
observing,networking,and experimenting throughout their lives.

2804. Probability: 0.9805
Look at PepsiCo chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi’s life to get a
glimpse ofwhere her TED in the head comes from.

2805. Probability: 0.9697
Nooyi’s diverse professional and personal experience convinced
her that people,and especially CEOs,must “be willing to think dis-
ruptively.”She did exactly that for the 2010 Super Bowl.Instead of
spending $20 million on two sixty-second television ad slots,
Nooyi took an entirely different approach,“Pepsi Refresh,”emerg-
ing from a question she constantly asks:“How can we dobetter by
doing better?”Pepsi Refresh invites people to submitideas on how
to “refresh”their communities,making them abetter place to live.

2806. Probability: 0.9922
Such analogies (or associations) are critical creative tools to help
him generate strategic insights.When the brain is actively absorb-
ing new knowledge,it is more likely to trigger connections between
ideas (thus creating a wider web ofneural connections) as it toils
to synthesize novel inputs.Accordingly,the associating “muscle”
can also be developed through the active practice ofquestioning,
observing,networking,and experimenting.

2807. Probability: 0.9606
Our analysis found that the best predictor of
excellent associating skills was how often people engaged in the
other discovery skills—questioning,observing,networking,and
experimenting.For example,Benioffgot the initial idea for Chat-
ter as he was asking,“Why isn’t all enterprise software like Face-
book and Twitter?”Research In Motion founder Lazaridis got the
idea for the BlackBerry at a conference as he listened to someone
talk about future trends in wireless data transfers.

Creating odd combinations, zooming in and out,
and Lego thinking allowed them to connect the dots across di-
verse experiences and ultimately deliver disruptive new business
ideas.

2811. Probability: 0.9935
Creating odd combinations
Neil Simon’s successful Broadway play and subsequent TV
series, The Odd Couple, centered on what life was like when
twovery different people—a prissy newsman and a sloppy sports-
writer—lived together as roommates.

2812. Probability: 0.9978
The friction between
opposite lifestyles often resulted in the most unexpected (and often
creative) outcomes.Similarly,innovators often try to put together
seemingly mismatched ideas to compose surprisingly successful
combinations.They create odd couples,triplets,or quadruplets
by consistently asking,“What if we combined this with that?”or

“...this,this,and this withthat?”They think different by fearlessly
uniting uncommon combinations ofideas.

Lazaridis noted that a teacher alerted him to the link between
computers and wireless by telling him,“Don’t get too distracted
with computer technology because the person that puts wireless
and computers together is really coming up with something spe-
cial.”And so the BlackBerry was born.

2814. Probability: 0.9973
Likewise,Google cofounder Larry Page created an odd combi-
nation by connecting two seemingly unrelated ideas—academic
citations withWeb search—to launch Google.As a PhD student
at Stanford, Page knew that academic journals and publishing
companies rank scholars by the cumulative number of citations
each scholar gets each year.Page realized that Google could rank
Web sites in the same way that academic citations rank scholars;
Websites with the most links (that were most frequently selected)
had more citations.This association allowed Page and cofounder
Sergey Brin to launch a search engine yielding far superior search
results.

Associating
Sometimes the world’s most innovative leaders capture what
seem like fleeting associations among ideas and knowledge,mixing
and matching quite different concepts.In so doing,they produce
the occasional outlandish ideas that may be catalysts for innovative
business ideas.EBay founder Pierre Omidyar gave us a recent ex-
ample of how he came up with a wild idea.He had spoken with
consultants who were trying to solve the problem of how to get
produce quickly from the farm to consumers in Hawaii before it
spoils (the consultants explained that roughly one-third ofthe pro-
duce spoils).The first question Omidyar asked was,“What about
the post office?

2816. Probability: 0.9857
So using those as-
sets in novel ways might be interesting.”
Not everyone would consider putting “fresh produce”and “post
office”together,but that’s the kind of thinking that increases the
probability ofsurfacing an innovative new business idea.

2817. Probability: 0.9943
Zooming in and zooming out
Innovative entrepreneurs often exhibit the capacity to do two
things at once: they dive deep into the details to understand the
subtle nuances of a particular customer experience,and they fly
high to see how the details fit into the bigger picture.Synthesizing
these two views often results in surprising associations.

2818. Probability: 0.9514
Niklas
Zennström (cofounder ofSkype) explained this process ofzoom-
ing in and out based on his own experience:“You have to think
laterally.You know,seeing and combining certain things going on
100092 02 041-064 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:57 AM Page 54

DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
at the same time and understanding how seemingly unrelated
things could have something to do with each other.You need the
ability to grasp different things going on at the same time and then
to bring them together.For example,I can look at the bigger pic-
ture and also have a very good feel for the details.So I can go be-
tween high-level things to really,really small details.The movement
often makes for new associations.”
Steve Jobs has mastered zooming in and out to create excellent
and often industry-changing products.At one point, when de-
signing the original Mac computer,his team struggled to get the
right finish on the plastic.Jobs unblocked the logjam by going to
a department store and zooming in on the details ofdifferent plas-
tic appliances.He discovered a Cuisinart food processor that had
all the right plastic-case properties for producing an excellent case
for the first Mac.In other instances,he visited the company park-
ing lot to examine details of different cars to gain new insights
about current or future product design challenges.One time,his
parking lot excursion revealed a Mercedes-Benz trim detail that
helped resolve a metal case-design dilemma.

2819. Probability: 0.9785
Jobs is equally adept at zooming out to detect unexpected
intersections across diverse industries.For example,as a result of
buying and then leading Pixar for over a decade,he acquired a per-
spective on the entire media industry that was quite different from
one he had gained earlier in the computer industry.This produced
a powerful intersection of ideas when he returned to Apple.Years
ofpersonal negotiation with Disney executives about distribution
rights and income for Pixar movies gave Jobs the insight and
experience that later helped him create a workable solution to
Internet-based music distribution—a solution that escaped senior
executives at other computer and MP3 player companies.Jobs’s
Pixar experience provided the broad cross-industry perspective that
has fueled the invention ofseveral game-changing ideas like iTunes,
iPod,iPhone,and most recently,the iPad.

2820. Probability: 0.9801
The more
building blocks they acquired,the better they were able to com-
bine newly acquired knowledge to generate a novel idea.

2821. Probability: 0.9900
To illustrate, think about a child playing with a set of Lego
blocks.The more different kinds ofblocks the child uses to build
a structure, the more inventive she can become.

2822. Probability: 0.9820
But the most
innovative structures spring from the novel combination ofa wide
variety ofexisting Legos,so as the child acquires different Lego sets
(for example,combining a Sponge Bob set with a Star Wars set),
she gets even better ideas for new structures.Similarly,the more
knowledge,experience,or ideas you add from wide-ranging fields
56
DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
to your total stock ofideas,the greater the variety ofideas you can
construct by combining these basic knowledge building blocks in
unique ways.(See figure 2-2.)
People with deep expertise in a particular field,who can com-
bine that knowledge with new concepts and ideas unfamiliar to
them,tend to be more creative.This is why innovation design firm
IDEO tries to recruit people who demonstrate a breadth ofknowl-
edge in many fields and a depth in at least one area of expertise.

2823. Probability: 0.9922

combinations) depends on how many unique thisand thatbuilding blocks

this knowledge profile typically generates innovative associations
in two ways:(1) by importing an idea from another field into his
area ofdeep expertise,or (2) by exporting an idea from his area of
deep expertise to one ofthe broad fields he is exploring where he
has shallow knowledge.

government implemented fixed-cost
reimbursements to reduce health care costs.The hospital needed
new ways to reduce costs,something it hadn’t focused on when
the government reimbursed for actual expenses plusa 10 percent
profit markup.During the discussion,the Bain consultant—with
deep expertise in the manufacturing sector—asked how the hos-
pital managed patient throughput,minimizing the “touches”to
the “product”(patient) and speeding its throughput through the
“plant”(hospital).These manufacturing-sourced ideas were com-
pletely foreign to the hospital,where processes focused on keeping
the patient longer to ensure quality care (and kept expenses and
profits high).These new ideas from an entirely different industry
delivered a dramatic redesign ofhospital processes designed to get
the patient through the hospital (like a plant) as quickly as possi-
ble.Within five years,Bain was working with over fifty U.S.hos-
pitals applying these ideas to reduce costs.

2826. Probability: 0.9801
A Safe Place for New Thoughts
After years of building a large stock of ideas through active
questioning,observing,networking,and experimenting,innova-
tors often make the most surprising associations.Sometimes an as-
sociation or idea sparked at the very moment they were engaged in
questioning,observing,networking or experimenting (as described
in chapters 3 through 6).Equally often,innovators uncovered new
ideas while in a relaxed state,without distractions,when they were

DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
not “trying”to solve a problem (researchers describe this as “defo-
cusing their attention”).In other words,it rarely happened during
a meeting when they were in a focused,convergent thinking mode
searching for a solution to a particular problem.Instead,Diane
Greene (cofounder ofVMWare) told us that “the shower”is a great
place to relax and think to get new ideas (a place frequently pitched
by many innovators we interviewed,including David Neeleman
[founder ofJetBlue and Azul] and JeffJones [founder ofCampus
Pipeline and NxLight]).Innovators also unearth new ideas while
walking,driving,on vacation,or in the middle ofthe night (as Pep-
siCo CEO Nooyi does).Benioff got the key inspiration for Sales-
force.com when “swimming with the dolphins.” In addition to
hitting the shower,Greene gets some of her best new associations
when sailing solo (which she has done since childhood).In short,
Greene explained,“You get more creativity by giving yourself the
space for ideas to simmer.Ideas come from having a longer time
horizon about what you’re thinking about and a broader view of
where the idea might be going to go.”The point is that you can
sometimes spend too much time deliberately attacking a problem
when some creative ideas will only emerge after putting yourselfin
a relaxed state with no distractions.6Ifall else fails when trying to
figure out a problem,go to sleep.Yes,Harvard researchers have
found that sleep is a consistent antidote to tunnel vision toward a
problem.So when find yourself stuck in a thinking rut,give the
problem extra time to percolate by adding some sleep into the mix.

Associating
Disruptive innovators force themselves to cross borders (techni-
cal,functional,geographical,social,disciplinary) as they engage in
the other discovery skills.Ifwe do the same,placing ourselves in midst
ofbustling intersections ofdiverse ideas and experiences,exciting as-
sociations will naturally happen.The discovery skills ofquestioning,
observing,networking,and experimenting will trigger surprising as-
sociations as we exercise them,over and over.Whether pursued out
ofthe office or in a conference room,great associations are more likely
to unfold when we create a safe place for them to happen.In time,
your capacity to craft creative solutions to problems will become pow-
erful,at work and beyond.

2828. Probability: 0.9690
Tip #1: Force new associations
Innovators sometimes practice “forced associating”or com-
bining things that we would never naturally combine.For exam-
ple, they might imagine (or force) the combination of features
in,say,a microwave oven with a dishwasher.This could deliver
an innovative product idea,such as a dishwasher that uses some
type ofheating technology to clean and sanitize dishes that elim-
inates water completely.Or in the case ofactual appliance compa-
nies, EdgeStar produced a countertop-size dishwasher, while
KitchenAid went for an in-sink approach.Both are the size of a

iPad product in your random page flipping and your

Tip #2: Take on the persona of a different company
Follow the lead of TBWA, which often holds a designated
“disruption day”to get new ideas.9After defining a key strategic
question or challenge,TBWA people haul out large boxes full of
hats,shirts,and other things from some of the most innovative
companies in the world,like Apple and Virgin.They put on the
clothing and assume the persona ofsomeone from that company
to look at their challenge from an entirely different perspective.

Alternatively,write down a list of companies (in related and
unrelated industries) on a stack of index cards (or randomly
godown the list ofthe Fortune 500 or Inc.100 companies).Use the
card stacks to create random pairings of your company with an-
other.Then creatively brainstorm ideas on how the two could cre-
ate new value through partnership or merger.By combining the
strengths ofboth companies,you may surprise yourselfwith new
products,services,or process ideas.

Questioning
Here’s where Gadiesh’s questioning skills best tackled the
client’s problem.She went to visit customers and started asking
questions,“Do you really need three hundred fifty products?”
“Why do you need all three hundred fifty products?”Their initial
autopilot answer was yes,but as she probed further with additional
questions,it became clear that customers didn’t fully grasp the cost
advantages that continuous casting offered due to its unique ca-
pacity to add other (lower-cost) materials during the steel-casting
process.Working with the client and customers,Gadiesh literally
went through each of the three hundred fifty products asking,
“Why do you have this?

2845. Probability: 0.9888
Based on the rich information gleaned from asking a series of
simple questions about why each product existed,Gadiesh naturally
moved from understanding what was to exploring in depth what
might be.She moved deeper into disruptive territory by asking fun-
damental questions such as:“What ifwe shrink the existing product
line by 90 percent?”“What if we cast steel continuously with that
sharply reduced product line?”“How might we maximize the addi-
tion of cost-saving materials when casting the steel?”Before long,
the steel company executives realized that reducing the number of
products from three hundred fifty to thirty not only was possible
but was the most profitable course ofaction because it would give
them a competitive advantage in the product segments in which
they did compete.This allowed them to add other materials like alu-
minum (thus reducing costs) through a new continuous-casting
process,while still meeting most oftheir key customers’needs.The
client (then a little over a billion-dollar enterprise) built a new pro-
duction facility and quickly raced ahead ofU.S.competitors.

2846. Probability: 0.9709
Gadiesh’s ability to generate new insights is largely based on
her ability to ask her way into what’s really going on and then push
the edge with constant,provocative questions about what might
be.

2847. Probability: 0.9664
Questions hold the potential to cultivate creative insights.Einstein
knew this long ago as he often repeated the phrase,“IfI only had the
right question ...IfI only had the right question ...”1No wonder he
finally concluded that “the formulation ofa problem is often more
important than its solution”andthat raising new questions to solve
a problem “requires creative imagination.”In The Practice ofMan-
agement,Peter Drucker grasped the same power ofprovocative ques-
tions,observing that “the important and difficult job is never to find
the right answers,it is to find the right question.For there are few
things as useless—if not dangerous—as the right answer to the
wrong question.”2Recent research by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi con-
firmed these personal convictions by finding that Nobel laureates
were far better at achieving breakthroughs once they found the right
question to reframe their problem.3Ourresearch also found that dis-
ruptors rely on crafting the right questions to accomplish their work.

Questioning
currently isand then rocketed to the skies for an equally compelling
search for what might be.Focusing on what is,they asked lots of
who,what,when,where,and how questions (as world-class jour-
nalists or investigators do) to dig beneath the surface and truly
“know the place for the first time”(as poet T.S.Eliot observed).

2851. Probability: 0.9852
Whether descriptive or disruptive,
innovators perpetually invoke powerful questions to help see be-
neath the surface ofeveryday action and discover what’s never been.

founder of Canadian-based Angiotech Pharmaceuticals,was in-
trigued by nontraditional ways that traditional drugs could be
used.He ended up inventing the first surgical stent that was coated
with a drug to reduce scar tissue (which causes up to a 20 percent
failure rate compared to uncoated stents).His insight on coating
stents came by changing the question traditional stent producers
were asking,“How can we build a better stent?”to a more pro-
ductive one,“What does the body do to these stents and why do
they fail?”His relentless pursuit of the latter question ended up
delivering a blockbuster product in the early 2000s.

From Collins’s initial “what caused?”question,a series of an-

resulted in a successful line of“12 Minute Games”sold through
Target.These games did the job many families needed at the end
of a busy day or long week,and the insight to that job came by
asking questions that gave simple,but critical,insights into what
was really going on in the inventor’s life.

Disrupting the Territory
After describing the territory well enough to thoroughly under-
stand what is,innovators started their search for new,potentially
disruptive solutions.They switched gears from descriptive ques-
tions to disruptive ones,like why,why not,and what if.

2855. Probability: 0.9658
(a Web platform that helps universities securely integrate cam-
puscommunication and resources) and NxLight (an IT tool for
simplifying the management of complex intercompany transac-
tions by easily and securely exchanging documents),grasps this
fact well, concluding:“Once you discover that asking why in a
different way and not being content with what the answer is,it’s
interesting what happens.You just have to go a little bit deeper
asking questions one or two more times in a different way.”This
is exactly what disruptive innovators do to discover new business
ideas.

2856. Probability: 0.9647
Consider the example ofEdwin Land,cofounder ofPolaroid.5
During a vacation with his family,Land took a picture ofhis three-
year-old daughter.She could not immediately see the picture he
had taken ofher and wanted to know why.And,like most young
children,probably asked why more than once.Her simple ques-
tion pushed Land,an expert in photographic emulsions,to think
deeply about the possibilities of “instant” photography.

2857. Probability: 0.9660
Within a few hours,the
scientist developed the basic insights that would eventually

produce instant photographs,a product that would transform his
company and disrupt an entire industry.In effect,his child’s naive
question challenged industry assumptions and transformed Land’s
technical knowledge into a revolutionary product—the Polaroid
camera.This industry-changing camera delivered incredible im-
pact between 1946 and 1986,ultimately selling over 150 million
units and an even higher volume ofexpensive film packs for use in
the cameras.

2858. Probability: 0.9927
Is there a better way?”This
question sparked an idea,“Why not give customers a code when
they buy a ticket that they could give us at the airport with their
identification?”This idea led to the creation of e-tickets,an idea
that eventually spread throughout the industry after Southwest
Airlines purchased Morris Air.

2859. Probability: 0.9864
Ask “what if” questions to impose constraints.

2860. Probability: 0.9993
To initiate a creative discussion about growth opportunities at
onecompany in our study,an executive asked this question:“Ifwe
were legally prohibited from selling our current products to our
current customers,how would we make money next year?”This

Questioning
constraining question led to an insightful exploration ofways the
company could find and serve new customers.

2861. Probability: 0.9972

For example,you and your team might ask:

2863. Probability: 0.9955
Asking questions that place constraints on solutions forces out-
of-the-box thinking because it ignites new associations.This is pre-
cisely what Apple did to come up with the iPod (“What if we
created an MP3 player that could fit in a shirt pocket but hold five
hundred to a thousand songs?”) and highly successful experience-
centered retail stores (“What ifwe used a regular-sized retail store
to sell a very small number ofApple-only products?”
Likewise,Hindustan Lever (Unilever’s business in India) won-
dered how it could reach millions ofpotential consumers in small
Indian villages where severe constraints existed:no retail distribu-
tion network,no advertising coverage,and poor roads and trans-
port.Collectively these constraints challenged its existing business
model and produced a fundamental question:“How might we
sellproducts in small villages withoutany access to traditional dis-
tribution networks,advertising,or infrastructure?”The answer
ultimately surfaced from direct-selling business models (from
companies like Avon).In close partnership with nongovernmen-
tal organizations,banks,and the government,Hindustan Lever
recruited women in self-help groups across rural India to become
direct-to-consumer sales distributors for its soaps and shampoos.

Ask “what if” questions to eliminate constraints.

2865. Probability: 0.9750
Great ques-
tions also eliminate the constraints that we can unnecessarily impose
on our thinking due to a focus on resource allocations,decisions,or
technology limitations.To counter this tendency,one innovative
CEO finds these questions key to eliminating unwanted sunk-cost
constraints:“What ifyou had not already hired this person,installed
this equipment,implemented this process,bought this business,or
pursued this strategy?

2866. Probability: 0.9771
Another approach to relaxing constraints surfaces in this ques-
tion:“What if X technology were available to every consumer?

2867. Probability: 0.9744
Many innovative founders and CEOs address the first
dilemma by cultivating an informal network of people whom
they can question, and who will question them.

Tips for Developing Questioning Skills
Innovators not only ask provocative questions, but constantly
work at asking better ones.For example,Michael Dell says that if
he had a favorite question to ask,everyone would anticipate it,
which wouldn’t make it very good.“Instead,I like to ask people
things that they don’t think that I’m going to ask them,”he told
us.“I kind ofdelight in coming up with questions that nobody has
the answer to quite yet.”To consistently craft better questions,here
are a few ofour favorite tips.

Consider,for example,how Ratan Tata,chairman of India’s
Tata Group,gained a powerful insight that inspired the world’s
cheapest car,the Tata Nano.Throughout Tata’s life,he had seen
89
100092 04 089-112 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:59 AM Page 90

DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
thousands of families riding scooters in India.On one very rainy
day in Mumbai, India, in 2003, however, he noticed a lower-
middle-class man riding a scooter with an older child standing in
the front,behind the handlebars.The man’s wife sat sidesaddle on
the back with another child on her lap.All four were soaked to the
bone as they hurried home.Tata saw with his eyes and listened
with his heart to notice what he had previously failed to notice.

2873. Probability: 0.9639
He asked himself,“Why can’t this family own a car and avoid the
rain?”Or,put another way,he thought about a job that needed
doing (in this case, the job was to create safe, affordable trans-
portation for a family that could not afford to buy a car,but could
buy a scooter).

2874. Probability: 0.9690
As mentioned, he got the idea for the Nano by
watching Indian families ride scooters in the rain.He knew that
the rural villages of India were a large market for scooters,so he
wanted to learn how Tata could sell the Nano in those villages to
replace the scooters.So he sent a team out to observe how Indians
in the rural areas purchased scooters.The team made some inter-
esting observations that led to a very different way to sell cars in the
villages.

2875. Probability: 0.9594
People would buy a
scooter, get a license, learn how to operate it, and then drive it
home thatsame day.So the Tata team brought in forty Nanos and
put them in the open-air market.They quickly found that cus-
tomers didn’t just walk up,buy a car,and drive it home.First,just
as in urban areas,many customers needed financing,so Tata had
to offer financing.But in order for people to drive away in a Nano,
100092 04 089-112 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:59 AM Page 92

the team learned that the customer needed to have insurance avail-
able on the spot.

2876. Probability: 0.9561
Even more
importantly,the team learned that most customers didn’t have a
driver’s license,so Tata had to offer a driver’s education class—and
a way to get a license—right there at the market.So Tata ended up
providing all these services in sequence so that within two to four
hours a customer could pick out a car, have it insured and
financed, receive training on how to operate it, get a driver’s
license,and finally register the car.Intense observation was the
only way Tata could see how to fully meet the needs ofa rural In-
dian who wanted to buy and drive a car.

2877. Probability: 0.9593
If we asked instead, “Why
aren’t students learning?” we might discover things that others
do not yet perceive.

2878. Probability: 0.9797
By understanding well the particular social and emotional
needs of high school students (the jobs these students want
done every day), the MET school, a charter school in Provi-
dence, Rhode Island, designed a project-based curriculum
where students work together each day on various projects
(containing elements of the Montessori method which provides
“hands on” interactive learning experiences).

2879. Probability: 0.9865
This approach
gives students an opportunity to have fun with friends while
feeling a sense of accomplishment because they can see how
their efforts move a project toward completion.

Cook’s observation convinced him that not only could the Lisa
perform repetitious financial functions,but that its easy-to-use
mouse and drop-down menus would allow the average person to
use a computer.He was completely intrigued by the concept of
making the items on a computer screen “work just like their real-
world counterparts.”(For example, a Quicken electronic check
looks just like a paper check.) By building a software program that
acted a lot like what people do in their daily lives,Intuit grabbed
over 50 percent ofmarket share the year after it was introduced.

For example,Gary Crocker,founder of the medical device firm
Research Medical Inc.(acquired by Baxter International),got the
idea for some “plumbing” devices that could help surgeons
perform heart bypass surgery after observing them do what was
100092 04 089-112 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:59 AM Page 98

DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
very new surgery at the time.He noticed the cardiovascular mon-
itoring catheters that were threaded into the heart to measure
blood pressure,but he also noticed that there weren’t any good
“plumber tools,”to manage the flow of blood.“There weren’t re-
ally big catheters that would take all the blood out ofthe body and
take it into the oxygenator when your lungs and heart are shut
down during surgery,”Crocker said.“There wasn’t a well-structured
plumbing line.

2884. Probability: 0.9722
So I thought I could create a product like that.

2885. Probability: 0.9848
That’s a nice little niche.”
So Crocker eventually left Baxter to start a company that cre-
ated a variety of specialized devices to control the flow of blood
during cardiac surgery.One device,Visuflo with Light Source,ad-
dressed the challenges of operating on bleeding sites in beating-
heart surgery by blowing a stream offiltered,humidified air onto
the suture site to remove unwanted blood flow that compromised
the surgeon’s visibility.

2886. Probability: 0.9551
The device also enhanced visibility by
providing an ancillary light source that could be directed into the
surgical opening.Without these devices,surgeons would come up
with their own ways to get more light into a surgical opening
(forexample,have a nurse shine a separate light into the opening)
or their own techniques to remove unwanted blood flow (for
example,trying different suction devices to remove blood).The
insights for Crocker’s innovative devices came only after carefully
observing the challenges that surgeons faced as they performed
cardiac surgery and the workarounds they developed to solve those
problems.

Chuck Templeton,founder ofOpenTable.com,witnessed these
workarounds firsthand in 1998 when his wife spent 3.5 hours
trying—without any luck—to get reservations at a desirable
restaurant when his in-laws visited them in Chicago.So Temple-
ton launched an online app that is essentially your own restaurant
concierge service:it allows customers to quickly and easily find a
restaurant they might like (by providing insightful reviews and
customer ratings),get a reservation at a convenient time (by al-
lowing customers to see table availability and book their own
reservation),and even have access to discounted meals (by giving
points for meal discounts).Restaurants pay OpenTable $199 per
month for the reservation service (to essentially rent a computer
terminal and Internet connection) and a $1 fee for every diner who
lands at their restaurant through the system.By doing a better job
of helping customers have a great dining experience,OpenTable
now dominates the dining reservation process in most large U.S.

While watching people trying to do a job to gain insights for
new product or service offerings seems straightforward,most com-
pany managers spend little time in this simple, commonsense
approach.But when companies uncover the hidden needs of the
customer through observation (whether it be serendipitous obser-
vation,live-in immersion,or video observation),they gain insights
that can prove extremely valuable.IDEO’s Kelley reports that when
designing a new kids’toothbrush for Oral-B,IDEO went out in the
field to watch kids brush their teeth.What it noticed was that kids’
toothbrushes were just smaller versions of adult toothbrushes,
which proved to be a challenge for them to hold and maneuver be-
cause they lacked the dexterity of their parents.This led to an in-
novative design: big, fat, squishy toothbrushes that were much
easier for kids to hold and use.The result?

So Wride,a software engineer by training,devised an ingen-
ious program that would allow a Portuguese speaker to watch
virtually any movie in English on her computer and then do four
things:(1) slow down the speech of the speaker;(2) select words
and hear them pronounced or defined,(3) identify idioms and
their meaning in her native language,and (4) insert her own pro-
nunciation into the mouth of the actor so she can hear whether
she sounds the same as the actor (hence, the Web site name,
MovieMouth.com).Wride’s insight for his business emerged by
observing that Brazilians who were supposed to be the best English
speakers (those attending the best English training programs) were
not the best speakers.

For example, Howard Schultz
started down the path to founding Starbucks when first confronted
with the intoxicating smell of Italian espresso bars,and Joe Mor-
ton,cofounder of XANGO,got the initial idea for a new health
drink in part by tasting mangosteen fruit for the first time in
Malaysia (more about this in chapter 5).In sum,remember to en-
gage all your senses as you search the world for surprises.

2896. Probability: 0.9719
For example,Starbucks founder Schultz engaged his sensory
organs—his eyes,ears,nose,and mouth—when he hit on the idea
for his coffee stores.Walking to a trade show in Milan,Italy,Schultz
randomly observed what happened in a number ofItalian espresso
bars.He could tell that the customers were regulars and that the
espresso bar “offered comfort,community,and a sense ofextended
family.”As Schultz continued visiting Italian espresso bars,he had
a revelation.“This is so powerful!

Without a willingness to actively observe in a new environment,
Schultz would never have come up with the ideas that led to Star-

Are there
ideas here for a new who,what,or howin my industry?”
Tip #3: Observe whatever strikes your fancy
Set aside ten minutes each day to simply observe something in-
tensively.Take careful notes about your observations.Then try to
figure out how what you are seeing might lead to a new strategy,
product,service,or production process.When you are out and
about watching the world,jot down your key observations and
thoughts on a notepad,and review your notes later,after a little
time has passed.Keep a small camera (still or video) with you to
take pictures ofinteresting things.The camera can remind you to
observe and note what is going on around you.(Amazon’s Bezos
confided that he often takes pictures of“really bad innovations”
to get ideas for things that might be done better.)
Tip #4: Observe with all your senses
As you observe customers, companies, or whatever, actively
engage more than one sense (see,smell,hear,touch,taste).One
structured way to do this is through Dialogue in the Dark (a prac-
tice developed by Andreas Heinecke) and Dialogue in Silence
100092 04 089-112 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:59 AM Page 111
111
Observing
(apractice developed by Heinecke and his wife Orna Cohen).In
these tours by visually or hearing-impaired guides,guests experi-
ence darkened or silent environments (ranging from permanent
exhibitions to restaurants located throughout the world) and enter
a completely different world of either darkness or silence.A less
structured approach to engaging your senses is to simply and in-
tentionally become aware of your wider range of senses.For ex-
ample,pay attention to what you smell next time you’re visiting
with customers (as Schultz did in Italy) or eat your next dinner in
slow motion,slowly savoring every bite and focusing only on the
taste,texture,and smell ofthe food.Or notice how a product really
feels as you touch it (when either using it or trying to understand
how it works).As you learn how to observe,pay close attention to
any creative insights the experience might trigger.Be sure to cap-
ture observations (sights,smells,sounds,touches,and tastes) in
your idea journal and explore where the insights might lead you.

To illustrate how building bridges into different social networks
can generate innovative new ideas,consider how Joe Morton,an
entrepreneur in the health and nutrition industry,got a billion-
dollar idea during a trip to Malaysia.(See figure 5-3.)
The figure shows Morton’s direct connections to numerous in-
dividuals within the health and nutrition industry (depicted by
line connections to circles).Morton also spent almost a year living
in Malaysia,where he learned about health and nutrition prod-
ucts Malaysians use from folks like Mahathir.(Mahathir represents
many people Morton spoke with.) “I had a number ofMalaysians
tell me about these two local fruits—durian, the king of fruit,
which supposedly heated the body up,and mangosteen,the queen
offruit,which cooled the body down and brought it into balance,”
Morton told us.“I thought durian smelled horrible,even though

Southeast Asians love it.But the mangosteen was delicious.Locals
said the husk offered numerous health benefits,including the abil-
ity to boost energy, reduce inflammations, and settle an upset
stomach.”
Even though Morton had significant experience in the health
and nutrition industry,he was not aware of any products in the
field using either durian or mangosteen.

2901. Probability: 0.9827
Through David,Morton learned that while there were no med-
ical studies on durian,there were numerous studies that indicated
positive health benefits associated with xanthones,polyphenolic
compounds found in abundance in mangosteen.These benefits
included anti-inflammatory properties, as Mahathir and other
Malaysians had suggested.Morton then used this information and
his network of contacts in the health and nutrition industry (in-
cluding cofounders Aaron Garrity and another brother,Gordon
Morton) to found XANGO (pronounced “Zango”) in 2002, a
company that sells XANGO (mangosteen) juice.With a unique
new product and an innovative network marketing approach,it
took XANGO only six years to become a $1 billion company.

2902. Probability: 0.9919
Morton would never have come up with the idea for mango-
steen juice if he hadn’t talked to Mahathir and other locals in
Malaysia.Morton bridged a gap between two networks:his health
and nutrition network ofcontacts in the United States and a net-
work of locals in Malaysia who had knowledge of homeopathic
herbs and fruits used there.The result:a very successful new prod-
uct idea.

2903. Probability: 0.9813
But like many innovators,he takes advantage ofevery opportunity
to talk to new people to see what he can learn.This habit produces
the novel idea now and again through serendipity.But effective
idea networkers also plan to find new ideas by regularly tapping
outside experts for ideas,by attending networking events,and by
building a personal network ofcreative confidants.

TV technology at every seat, at-home reservationists, and the
hundred-seat JetBlue Embraer jet,through networking at confer-
ences and elsewhere.

2911. Probability: 0.9792
Says Neeleman: “I always had this gnaw-
ing thought in my mind that ‘I’ve got to do something in the
seat-back pocket of each plane seat.’So I talked to a lot of people
ata lot ofcompanies about different entertainment options.Then
one day, in the early days of JetBlue, I talked to someone who
said,‘Look at this brochure on a company that can do live televi-
sion on airplanes,’and I said,‘That’s it.That’s exactly what we want
to do.’”
Not only did Neeleman follow up on the suggestion,he bought
LiveTV,the company with the technology to provide satellite TV
on airplanes.By purchasing the only company with such technol-
ogy,he prevented competitors from offering satellite television to
their passengers,thereby creating a competitive advantage for Jet-
Blue.Until recently,any competitor who wanted to offer satellite
TV to passengers had to purchase it from JetBlue.

2912. Probability: 0.9838
In addition to attending conferences,some innovators create
networking opportunities within their companies.For example,
Richard Branson created an idea networking process when found-
ing Virgin Music.He bought an old castle and transformed it into
a conversation hub for diverse people from the entertainment in-
dustry,including musicians,artists,producers,filmmakers,and
otherwise.Branson understands that creating networking oppor-
tunities within Virgin produces conversations between people that
just might trigger innovative ideas.

2913. Probability: 0.9957
Form a Personal Networking Group
We found that many innovators build a small network of people
who are their “go to”folks when they want to find or test new
ideas.For example,innovative entrepreneurs JeffJones (founder of
Campus Pipeline and NxLight) and Eliot Jacobsen (RocketFuel
Ventures) described how they liked to get together to jam (to use
a music or jazz metaphor) to get new ideas.“I have a few people
Ilike to get together with when I’m in need ofa boost to my cre-
ative juices,”Jones told us.“Eliot Jacobsen is one ofmy friends that
I love to talk to because we just energize each other and build on
each others’ideas.”Jacobsen agreed,saying,“Jeff Jones is one of
those people I like to talk to on a regular basis because we just con-
nect in a creative way.”
In similar fashion,we found that many innovators have a small
group ofcreative confidants that they converse with whenever they
need some fresh ideas—or someone to challenge their current
ideas.Usually this network is relatively small (e.g.,fewer than five
people),but some innovators have actively created larger networks.

Tip #5: Invite an outsider
Bring in a smart person with a different background (some-
one from a different function, profession, company, industry,
country,age,ethnic group,socioeconomic group) to have lunch
with you and your team once each week.Ask the person about
your innovation challenges and get his or her perspective on your
ideas.Or hold an open house for ideas,inviting two to four peo-
ple from a variety of perspectives,including nonexperts who are
new to a situation,to present their ideas and viewpoints.

2916. Probability: 0.9711
Within the year,Bezos launched Amazon.com and dubbed it
“Earth’s Biggest Bookstore.” Using book wholesaler Ingram to
warehouse and ship books,Amazon offered the largest selection
ofbooks anywhere,without having made anyinvestment in stores,
warehouses, or inventory.

2917. Probability: 0.9895
But Bezos had bigger dreams than
simply selling books.

2918. Probability: 0.9791
But Bezos isn’t done experimenting with business models.

2919. Probability: 0.9609
Where did Bezos’s penchant for experimenting come from?

2920. Probability: 0.9658
“I really gained confidence in my creative ability by
helping my grandfather fix things on his ranch,”he told us.“He
often didn’t have the money to fix things,so we’d have to impro-
vise.One time I helped him fix a Caterpillar tractor using nothing
but a three-foot-high stack ofmail-order manuals.You learn that
when one way doesn’t work,you have to regroup and try another
approach.”
Bezos’s experience has taught him that experimenting is so crit-
ical to innovation that he has tried to institutionalize it at Ama-
zon.“Experiments are key to innovation because they rarely turn
out as you expect,and you learn so much,”Bezos told us.“I en-
courage our employees to go down blind alleys and experiment.

2921. Probability: 0.9914
Frequently experiments to create new ways of doing things.

2922. Probability: 0.9774
Innovators understand that diversity ofexperience allows you
to engage in divergent thinking,as you draw on a broader set of
ideas when associating.“Of course,it was impossible to connect
the dots looking forward when I was in college,”Jobs says.“But it
was very clear looking backward ten years later.

2923. Probability: 0.9960
Take,for instance,the example of Kristen Murdock,an entre-
preneur who literally figured out how to turn cow pies (manure)
into money.

2924. Probability: 0.9761
Within a few days,some ofthem started to disintegrate.So to
keep them intact,she applied a glaze and liked what she saw.They
were like shiny,petrified pieces ofwood,and she thought they were
pretty due to the color variations or the interesting rocks embed-
ded in them.Then one night while lying in bed,she hit on the idea
to insert a clock into the petrified cow pie and give it away as a gag
gift.So she started inserting clocks into the cow pies and giving
them to girlfriends with funny sayings,like:“You Dung Good,”or
“For all you do,this crap for you.”“None of my girlfriends liked
them,”she says.“They hated them ...they thought it was so sick.”
Her big break came after she gave a clock to a relative,who was a
friend of entertainer Donny Osmond.

2925. Probability: 0.9847
But she didn’t stop there.She kept all ofthe funny sayings peo-
ple sent her and created a cow-pie greeting card line.She hired a
graphic designer to create a signature cow and cow pie and sold a
line ofcow-pie greeting cards to Hallmark.The business has been
extremely profitable because she gets paid a royalty for the ideas
and cow-pie brand,but she doesn’t have to actually print the cards.

DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
As in Jobs’s experience with calligraphy,Murdock had no way of
knowing that collecting cow pies could lead to any practical ap-
plication in her life.It all started because she was curious enough
to collect a few cow pies while wandering in the desert.Murdock
jokingly sums up her success saying,“I’m an entre-manure.”
Innovators like Bezos and Murdock seem to intuitively under-
stand the value that can come from trying out new experiences in
new environments.Our research on innovators revealed that one
ofthe most powerful experiments innovators can try out is living
and working in different cultures.The more countries someone
lives in,the more likely he or she is to leverage that experience to
deliver innovative products,processes,or businesses.Individuals
who live in a foreign country for at least three months are 35 per-
cent more likely to start an innovative venture or invent a product
(each additional country brings additional benefit,though there
are diminishing returns after living in two countries).Moreover,if
managers try out even one international assignment before be-
coming CEO,their companies deliver stronger financial results
than companies run by CEOs without such experience,roughly
7percent higher market performance on average.2And part ofthat
performance premium comes from the innovation capability that
a CEO has acquired by living overseas.

2927. Probability: 0.9719
Lafley, for example, spent time as a student
studying history in France; later on,he ran retail operations on
U.S.military bases in Japan.He eventually returned to Japan as
head ofP&G’s Asia operations before becoming CEO.His diverse
international experience served him well as the leader of one of
the oldest and most innovative companies in the world.Similarly,
innovator Reed Hastings’s experience working for the Peace Corps
in Swaziland continues to influence his innovative strategy and
leadership (as founder and CEO) ofhighly successful Netflix.

2928. Probability: 0.9648
Finally,taking the opportunity to learn new skills in different
arenas—as Jobs did when learning calligraphy—can boost your
innovation capability.For example,Nate Alder (inventor of the
Klymit vest) decided to pick up scuba diving during a trip to
Brazil.During the scuba certification,he learned about argon gas
as an insulator to keep dry suits warm.He thought,“Hey,that’s a
cool idea.I wonder ifI could put argon gas in a snowboard jacket
to keep me warm?” (Alder was a snowboard instructor at the
time.) This experience was the catalyst for the creation of the
Klymit vest (insulated with argon gas) and a variety ofother prod-
ucts using argon gas.As described in chapter 2,innovators tend to
be T-shaped in terms oftheir expertise,with deep knowledge in at
least one area and some expertise in a wide variety of knowledge
areas.Developing new skills in new areas is a great way to build
diversity ofknowledge in your head.

2929. Probability: 0.9945
In summary,living in a different country,working in a differ-
ent industry,and learning a new skill are three ways to try out new
experiences and boost your creativity.Experimenters seek these
types of experiences because they expand the diversity of their
knowledge and increase their capacity to innovate.

Take Apart Products, Processes, and Ideas
In 1980,Michael Dell looked forward with great anticipation to
his sixteenth birthday.However,he was most excited because his
parents had finally agreed to let him purchase his own computer—
an Apple II.On the day the computer arrived,Dell was so anxious
to get his hands on it that he made his dad drive him down to the
UPS office to pick it up.

2931. Probability: 0.9842
What he did next both shocked and
dismayed his parents,but it also proved to be instrumental in his
discovery of the “direct from Dell” business model.

2932. Probability: 0.9838
Thus,the “direct from Dell”business model was born.

2933. Probability: 0.9956
Like Dell,many innovators hit on an innovative idea while tak-
ing something apart—a product,a process,a company,a technol-
ogy.

2934. Probability: 0.9799
For example, Google’s Page is also a tinkerer who likes to
deconstruct things.Page’s brother gave him a set of screwdrivers
when he was nine years old,which he used to completely take apart
every power tool his family had in the house.In similar fashion,
Page tinkered with various ideas related to efficiently searching the
Web,eventually hitting on the page-ranking idea that searched the
Web in a way that was very different from the other search engines
at the time.

2935. Probability: 0.9568
One hot summer day, he decided to
drop in on an encryption technology lecture at Stanford Univer-
sity to see if he could spawn any ideas to further his dream.Only
six people attended the lecture, so it wasn’t hard to start up a
conversation with Peter Thiel, a hedge fund manager who was

146
DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
interested in using encryption technology to secure financial trans-
actions.

2936. Probability: 0.9592
The two immediately hit it off and decided to start a
company based on security software for handheld devices like the
Palm Pilot.

2937. Probability: 0.9700
The initial idea was to turn the Palm Pilot into a wallet, in
which users could secure private information like credit card num-
bers or passwords.They launched the product with great antici-
pation but soon learned that the market was quite small,limited
tothose few users ofPalm Pilots who cared about securing private
information.So they decided to try out a different business idea:
provide software that would allow a Palm Pilot to store money that
could be beamed from one Palm Pilot to another.

2938. Probability: 0.9664
So Levchin and Thiel developed software that could beam
money from one Palm Pilot to another.This business idea caught
the attention ofsome leading venture capital companies in Silicon
Valley,leading to PayPal’s first round offinancing at Buck’s restau-
rant,a favorite restaurant for many venture capitalists.PayPal’s in-
vestors showed up with $4.5 million preloaded on a Palm Pilot
that they beamed to Levchin and Thiel’s Palm Pilot.PayPal seemed
to be on its way.

2939. Probability: 0.9945
They like to throw new product, process, and
business ideas against the wall to see what will stick.

2940. Probability: 0.9870
The first was on the Harvard University campus; they
rented dresses to Harvard undergrads,letting young women try
on thedresses first.The pilot was an unqualified success.Women
not only rented the dresses but returned them in good condition.

2941. Probability: 0.9946
This innovation completely changed Southwest’s strategy and
business model,as well as its bottom line.

2942. Probability: 0.9620
Similarly,IKEA never intended to have knockdown kit furni-
ture (disassembled furniture in flat parcel boxes) as a central feature
of its low-cost furniture retailing model.A serendipitous experi-
ment early on in the company’s history yielded an important in-
sight.

2943. Probability: 0.9794
After completing a photo shoot for a furniture catalog,
amarketing manager found not all the furniture fit back into the
trucks.When a photographer suggested that they take the legs off
the table and then slide the table into the truck,the lights went on:
Ikea could knock down almost all its furniture to reduce shipping
costs and make the customer the final assembler.This small ex-
periment was critical to IKEA’s business model as a global furni-
ture retailer.

2944. Probability: 0.9735
Build a prototype of your new,im-
proved invention from random materials in your house or office,

Experimenting
or go on a shopping spree to obtain odd things that might work
well in the prototype.Play-Doh (the children’s modeling clay) is a
great medium for creating prototypes.If you are feeling adven-
turous and want to splurge,you may even want to buy a three-
dimensional printer that produces objects on demand (according
to your design).

2945. Probability: 0.9724
Tip #7: Go trend spotting
Actively seek to identify emerging trends by reading books,
articles,magazines,Web links,blogs,and other sources that specif-
ically focus on identifying new trends.Read material written by
individuals you believe excel at identifying trends and seeing what’s
next.Try reading the work ofKevin Kelly (executive editor ofWired
and author of New Rules for the New Economy),Chris Anderson
(editor in chiefofWiredand author ofThe Long Tailand Free),or
another author who is looking into the future.Then think about
how these trends might lead to an interesting experiment with
regard to a new product or service.Figure out a way to creatively
conduct that experiment.

2947. Probability: 0.9622
India’s Hindustan Lever (number seven) not only has been a
consumer products innovator but,as described in chapter 3,has
also used an innovative network-marketing approach to sell its
products through thousands of underprivileged rural women
throughout India.This has allowed Hindustan Lever to sell in over
135,000 villages and become the most trusted Indian brand—used
by two out of three Indians.The U.K.’s Reckitt Benckiser Group
(number eight) has been an innovation powerhouse with roughly
40 percent of revenue in recent years coming from innovations
launched in the prior three years.Many ideas come through net-
working with outsiders via its IdeaLink Web site where it lists
jobsthat need to be done and requests solutions.The company is
currently hunting for “methods for detection of parasites and
other parasite eggs”among other things.Denmark’s Vestas Wind
Systems (number eleven) recently won the “Innovation Cup”as
the country’s most innovative company.It is the world’s leading
supplier of wind power solutions and has spawned a number of
innovations,including floating foundations for wind power sta-
tions at water depths ofover thirty meters.

2948. Probability: 0.9725
We started by asking innovative founders at some of these
firms, like Amazon’s Bezos or Salesforce.com’s Benioff: What
makes your firm so innovative?

2949. Probability: 0.9877
People at Amazon say,‘We’re going to
figure out how to do this.’”
To sum up:Bezos looks for people with an inventive attitude
like his.He personally experiments as a way to generate innovative
ideas, so he’s created processes at Amazon that encourage and
support experimenting by others.And he asks why not and is will-
ing to take leaps (as he did leaving D.E.Shaw to start Amazon;he
certainly did not “stick to his knitting”when he made that career
decision).Not surprisingly,this philosophy has become part ofthe
culture at Amazon in which others are also expected to ask why
not and take leaps.

2950. Probability: 0.9708
Processes
Just as inventive people systematically engage their questioning,
observing, networking, and experimenting skills to spark new
ideas,we discovered that innovative organizations systematically
develop processes to encourage these same skills in employees.

In this chapter, we have identified some of the world’s
most innovative companies and provided a framework to help you
see how creative organizations do it.

2953. Probability: 0.9782
Our organization or team frequently engages in brain-
storming to generate wild or very different ideas by
drawing analogies from other products, companies, or
industries.

2954. Probability: 0.9747
Your team or or-
ganization scores very high on the innovator’s DNA if the total
score is 45 or above; high if the score is 40–45; moderate to
high if the score is between 35 and 40; moderate to low if the
score is 30–34; low if the score is below 30.

2955. Probability: 0.9865
Jobs
assembled a team of brilliant engineers, gave them the needed
resources, and infused the Macintosh team with a vision of what
was possible.

2956. Probability: 0.9973
That’s what an innovative leader does.

2957. Probability: 0.9889
He had observed that one of those teams, the
six-person DP team, had been the most innovative for the past
five years.

2958. Probability: 0.9941
The team had pioneered a number of innovations, but
perhaps the most valuable were clever “productivity games” for
enticing users to give feedback on key Microsoft products.

2959. Probability: 0.9944
For instance, the DP team members created whimsical
games that presented each of the Windows dialogues in a dif-
ferent language for native speakers.

2960. Probability: 0.9762
To get feedback, they sent
the game to the thousands of Microsoft employees who spoke
a language other than English, from Chinese to Slovakian.

2961. Probability: 0.9731
We tested and confirmed Bean’s hypothesis with
our 360-degree innovator’s DNA assessment.

2962. Probability: 0.9544
In short, the team achieved higher synergies in
discovery because team members brought different novel in-
puts to the team through different discovery skills.

2963. Probability: 0.9896
“All I know,”
says Bean, “is that the discussions we have in this team are the
most creative and stimulating I have run into at Microsoft.

2964. Probability: 0.9571
And
that makes it really fun to work in the team.” It also didn’t hurt that
team leader Smith, according to team members, is someone who
“trusts his people,” “encourages folks to come up with new ideas
and take risks,” “values independent thinkers,” “encourages and
inspires new ideas,” and “evangelizes the work of others and has
a tendency to downplay his own contribution.” In short, Smith has
done exactly what a good leader does to create a safe space for
others to innovate (more on this in chapter 9).

2965. Probability: 0.9895
Beyond Microsoft, we noticed similar patterns in other highly
innovative teams.

2966. Probability: 0.9626
Dell recalled:
I gave Kevin a Curious George stuffed animal.The Curious
George is for Kevin to ask questions,to be a little more
inquisitive.Kevin responded by giving me a toy bulldozer
driven by a little girl with a huge smile on her face.Some-
times I’ll get really excited about an idea and I’ll just start
driving it.Kevin put the bulldozer on my desk,and it’s a
signal to me to say “Wait a second,I need to push it a little
more and think through it for some others and kind of
slow down on this great idea that I’m working on.”We
don’t use them that much,but they’re subtle little jokes
between us.

2967. Probability: 0.9740
Rollins acknowledged that Dell and he played different roles,
telling us,“Michael simply owns more ofthe entrepreneurial juice
stuff.He has an idea a day,an hour.In big companies,you can’t do
an idea a day.I’m the governor ofthe innovation engine.”
Similarly,eBay’s Pierre Omidyar was aware that he was strong at
discovery but weak at execution.Identifying this need for stronger
execution skills on his team,he invited JeffSkoll,a Stanford MBA,
to join him.“Jeff and I had very complementary skills,”Omidyar
told us.“I’d say I did more ofthe creative work developing the prod-
uct and solving problems around the product,while Jeff was in-
volved in the more analytical and practical side of things.He was
the one who would listen to an idea ofmine and then say,‘OK,let’s
figure out how to get this done.’”Omidyar grasped the power of
complementary skills when building a top management team at
eBay.

Stage four is the “capture value”stage when the product launches
to the market.While this stage centers mostly on delivery in terms
ofmanufacturing,marketing,distributing,and selling the product,
discovery skills can still generate value as BIG searches for innova-
tive ways to manufacture,market (brand),distribute,and sell (price)
the product.“You can find ways to innovate at any stage of the
innovation process,”says Collins.In fact,BIG is quite innovative in
this final stage ofthe innovation funnel,using a wider variety ofdis-
tribution channels for its inventor-produced pipeline of products
than a typical company.

2971. Probability: 0.9709
If you looked at the bag straight on, it was a
beautiful purple color.

If you looked at it at a different angle, it
was pink.

2973. Probability: 0.9887
By using technologies that
allowed polymers to absorb or repel wavelengths, the team cre-
ated a gift bag that could literally change colors.

2974. Probability: 0.9978
“The market’s not big
enough.”
From Christensen’s view, this was an amazing gift bag.

2975. Probability: 0.9852
The
market for these types of bags must be huge.

2976. Probability: 0.9861
This led to
the question, what if the team just raised the price on the bags
to reach the target margin of 55 percent?

2977. Probability: 0.9981
The challenge was finding a way to profitably take this
innovative product to market.

2978. Probability: 0.9652
Like IDEO,Apple spurs innovation by filling its ranks with peo-
ple who possess various different types of expertise.“Part of what
made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were
musicians,and poets,and artists,and zoologists,and historians,who
also happened to be the best computer scientists,”says Jobs.“The
reason Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we al-
ways try to be at the intersection oftechnology and liberal arts,to be
able to get the best ofboth.”1The key point is that innovative com-
panies select a mix ofpeople who possess not only complementary
discovery and delivery skills,but also different expertise and diver-
sity ofbackgrounds to look at problems through multiple lenses.

Bezos and his team determined that the likely root cause ofthe
associate’s damaged thumb was needing a place to put his bag but
not having one around he used the conveyor as a table.To eliminate
further safety incidences,the team provided portable,lightweight
tables at the appropriate stations and additional safety training to
alert associates about the dangers ofconveyor belt work.While this
innovation was minor,one Amazon member,Pete Abilla,said it was
a transforming experience “that I carry with me to this day.”Abilla
went on to describe several things that he learned.

Our observations of Apple (number one on the BusinessWeek

you could almost say the company uses a five what-ifs process as it

been created had it not been for Jobs and his leadership team ask-
ing effective what-if questions.

Keyence Corporation (number twenty-three on our list), a
Japanese company that specializes in factory automation devices
such as electronic sensors,makes sure that 25 percent of the de-
vices it sells every year are new products and more advanced than
anything rivals can offer.New product ideas surface mostly from
the hands-on experience of seven thousand salespeople who
proactively head to the production floors of some fifty thousand
customers.Salespeople are required to spend hours observing cus-
tomer manufacturing lines to gain insights into their problems.By
watching the production lines ofinstant noodle makers,Keyence
learned that noodle quality was compromised because they were
manufactured at variable thicknesses.So Keyence developed laser
sensors that could measure noodles to 1/100th of a millimeter.

Roughly two-dozen human

Consumer products giant Reckitt Benckiser (RB) (number
eight on our list) has seen similar results using its IdeaLink Web
site where it lists its “most wanted”jobs that need to be done and
requests solutions.For example,RB launched Finish Quantum,a
new dishwasher detergent designed to provide maximum clean
and shine.The driving force behind Quantum’s “clean and shine”
performance is three highly active chemical agents that are nor-
mally incompatible.The challenge was to combine them in a sin-
gle product but hold them apart.Working closely with external
experts,RB developed an innovative polymer system and process-
ing technique to create a dissolvable shell with three chambers that
separate each agent until it’s needed.

Through unscripted conversations, IDEO team members
gained critical insights for designing novel kitchen gadgets.They
tried to gain deep empathy to the point that they could champion
a particular user,such as a chef.They tried to understand what
sheloves,what her challenges are,and what’s really important to
her,so they could share that person’s story later with other team
members.Peter Killman,a project leader at IDEO,says that dur-
ing the observing and networking phase,IDEO teams “go out to
the four corners ofthe earth and come back with the golden keys
ofinnovation.”7Those keys,observation and idea networking,help
unlock the doors to innovative ideas.

For example, the new cheese grater design has a large
drum to grate cheese as it rolls and can grate more cheese (or choco-
late or nuts) with less cranking.An optimized,clog-resistant tooth
pattern provides maximum grating with minimal resistance for
older users and people with small hands.The foldable and oppos-
able hand crank makes for efficient drawer storage and for easy use
by right- and left-handed users.These innovations are refined with
each new prototype because IDEO “builds to think and thinks to
build,”as Matt Adams put it.Taking the prototype out for a test drive
is the fastest way to get great feedback on new product ideas.

THE DNA OF DISRUPTIVE ORGANIZATIONS AND TEAMS
Not surprisingly,the same innovators worked equally hard to
infuse a parallel set of taken-for-granted philosophies deep into
every nook and cranny of their company’s culture (just as Bezos
did at Amazon).They recognized that a culture is most powerful
when widely shared and deeply held.So how did they do this?

The Emmy award–winning Think Different campaign was
hailed as one of the most innovative of all time,largely because
it inspired people.

Of course,bold actions must follow bold statements to rein-
force the message.P&G’s Lafley pursued the “we innovate”phi-
losophy when he remarked,“The P&G of five or six years ago
depended on eight thousand scientists and engineers for the vast
majority of innovation.The P&G we’re trying to unleash today
asks all hundred thousand-plus of us to be innovators.”To rein-
force his commitment to organizationwide innovation,he actively
solicited ideas from throughout the company,and if the concept
showed promise,he put it into development.For example,Lafley
backed a successful hair-care product line for women ofcolor be-
cause a few African American employees explained to him that ex-
isting products didn’t work well and “we can do better.”P&G did
better,launching a successful new line,Pantene Pro-V Relaxed &
Natural.Lafley’s actions set the tone for a we-innovate philosophy
to take hold.

Like Google,3M has long been known for a similar 15 percent
rule,and at P&G,some employees said they were encouraged to
devote 75 percent oftheir time working “in the system”(e.g.,exe-
cuting tasks) and 25 percent working “on the system”(e.g.,dis-
covering new and better ways to execute).Other companies,such
as Apple and Amazon,give no explicit time allocation,but regu-
larly ask employees to run experiments and work on innovation
projects.Alternatively,Atlassian Labs (an innovative Australian-
based company that makes software development and collabora-
tion tools) employs a unique variation ofthe 20 percent innovation
time rule.It conducts an annual “FedEx”day when all software de-
velopers devote twenty-four hours nonstop to generating new
product ideas.Developers work intensely to build a viable “FedEx
Shipment Order”that sufficiently details a new idea for others to
review.Twenty-four hours later,Atlassian holds a “FedEx Deliv-
ery”day when developers rapidly prototype and then demonstrate
new software ideas for others in the company.This annual inno-
vation effort has proved highly successful,as developers experi-
ence more fun and growth in their work and ultimately help
product managers fill in product holes with new options.

Companies incorporate innovation, creativity, and
curiosity into their core values, in word and deed.

3011. Probability: 0.9738
In contrast,companies design disruptive innovation projects
to establish entirely new markets by offering a unique value propo-
sition through more radical technologies.(Technologies become
more radical by incorporating entirely new components—compared
to established products—and offering new linkages among com-
ponents within a new product architecture.) Sony’s Walkman was
disruptive because it opened up a fundamentally new market by
offering a music device that was far more portable than any other
music device.The Walkman was based on new miniaturized com-
ponents and new linkages (interfaces) between those components.

3012. Probability: 0.9871
Apple took a similar leap forward with iPod and iTunes that,
225
Philosophies
compared to Walkman,were based on very different components
and product architecture to open up portable music to a far larger
customer group.Over 95 percent ofiPod buyers had never used an
Apple computer and over 80 percent had never used a portable
music device.

3013. Probability: 0.9956
That is opening up an entirely new market.

3014. Probability: 0.9775
The
iPhone is also disruptive,not so much because the technologies
employed were so different (though some were),but because it
had a very different architecture (one button,touch screen) and
because ofthe “App store,”which allowed the device to do so many
more jobs than a typical cell phone.Amazon’s Kindle e-reader and
cloud computing services represent similar disruptive innovations
by opening up completely new markets.

3015. Probability: 0.9648
In similar fashion,Google engineers typically work in teams
ofonly three to six people.Chairman Schmidt explains the inten-
tion:“We try to keep it small.You just don’t get productivity out
oflargegroups.”7The result is an empowered,flexible organization
with small teams pursuing hundreds ofprojects,an approach that
Schmidt claims “let[s] a thousand flowers bloom.”8With hundreds
ofsmall team projects developing new ideas,it is little wonder that
Google can create so many new product offerings.

3016. Probability: 0.9530
Alternatively, they might use a lightweight team that primarily
comes from the game console group but includes a light alloca-

Sony.

3017. Probability: 0.9814
But imagine that Sony wants to develop an iPad-like device that
possesses features that leapfrog iPad (let’s call it the sPad).IfSony
attempts to develop the new sPad device withinthe PS3 engineer-
ing group, the new device will likely reflect the knowledge and
technology ofan existing Sony game console.The same would be
true if the Sony computer engineering group or the Sony TV
group developed the device.To get something more radical,Sony
would be better offpulling folks from each ofthese areas (and per-
haps elsewhere) into a heavyweight team or autonomous business
unit.

3018. Probability: 0.9760
For example,when Amazon decided to pursue and then launch a
cloud computing service business,it created an autonomous busi-
ness unit because the new opportunity demanded an entirely dif-
ferent business model from its online discount retailing business.

Somehow pursuing disruptive innovations with this type ofteam
feels less risky (than doing it with a more common delivery-driven
management team) because these folks boast strong discovery
skills and understand the behaviors (and processes) required for
generating a successful disruption.No wonder the risk seems more
calculated with them.The actual risk islow because putting the right
people and innovation processes into place increases the proba-
bility ofsuccess (and decreases the probability oftaking disastrous
steps).

On a smaller scale but a highly similar focus, we have also
worked with social innovators around the world who rely on
innovator’s DNA skills to create profound solutions to some of
society’s most difficult problems.For example,Andreas Heinecke
founded a for-profit social enterprise,Dialogue in the Dark,when
working as a newspaper journalist in Germany.Heinecke’s boss
had brought a blind coworker to his desk and asked him to teach
the person how to become a journalist.Heinecke had no idea how
to approach the situation,but quickly threw himselfinto the task
of figuring out how to make it work,in part because he had less
than perfect hearing.Heinecke not only helped his blind colleague
to become a journalist but,in the process,used his innovator’s
DNA skills to found Dialogue in the Dark,which hires blind ex-
perts to take sighted visitors into a world ofcomplete darkness for
one to three hours.(Our assessment showed Heinecke as excep-
tional at idea networking and questioning.) Heineke observed that
to better understand and appreciate blind people,you must expe-
rience the world as they do.

3025. Probability: 0.9668
To date,over 6 million visitors in thirty different countries have
experienced the exhibitions where people learn to navigate
through parks and across streets,and to eat in completely dark
spaces.Dialogue in the Dark also conducts very successful leader-
ship development sessions at companies and conferences,includ-
ing the World Economic Forum Davos events.

3026. Probability: 0.9582
In the end,most of us will likely make a difference through
many minor (derivative) innovations.An idea with impact might
be a new process for hiring that helps your company find more
talented people (such as Google’s Code Jam tournament described
in chapter 9).It might be a new approach to marketing your com-
pany’s products (such as P&G’s new use ofbloggers and customer-
generated content described in chapter 9).Or it might be building
a business model based on the premise that for every pair ofshoes
sold,the company will give away one pair,as Blake Mycoskie did
when he founded TOMS Shoes (after traveling to Argentina in
2006 and seeing so many children with foot diseases because they
lacked shoes).

3027. Probability: 0.9817
Clearly,the process of creative discovery can be difficult,but
the rewards far outstrip the challenges.Being a creator is exciting,
and to author or coauthor an idea that leads to a new product,
service,process,or business energizes.Being an innovator is psy-
chologically and emotionally gratifying in a way that money
simply isn’t,even though the financial rewards ofsuccessful inno-
vation can be significant.Mark Ruiz,co-founder ofMicroVentures
and finalist for the Entrepreneur of the Year Philippines 2010
award,admitted the same when he told us,“even though I’m an
entrepreneur,what drives me is not really the money.What really
drives me is a deep sense ofmission and purpose.I just see prob-
lems that are screaming for new and innovative solutions.”Ruiz
works nonstop to build new venture after new venture to take on
these problems in his home country,the Philippines.

3028. Probability: 0.9931

Our research project consisted of two phases: (1) an inductive
study ofinnovators compared with noninnovators,and (2) a large
sample study comparison of roughly eighty innovators and
roughly four hundred noninnovator executives (we later expanded
this to a larger sample).We conducted exploratory interviews with
a sample ofroughly thirty innovative entrepreneurs and a similar
number of senior executives in larger organizations (see a sub-
sample ofinnovators we interviewed in appendix A).The goal of
our interviews with innovators was to understand when and how
they personally came up with creative ideas on which they built
new innovative businesses.We asked questions such as:

One place to start is asking someone to serve as your creative men-

work on developing new behavioral patterns.Personal change is
difficult,and asking someone you respect to help with the change
effort is an important step (getting one person engaged in the
change process will bump up your success rate 15 percent to 20 per-
cent).The coach can be a boss,peer,professor,classmate,or even
someone you live with (you might practice these skills with other
family members as you attempt to creatively solve problems at
home).But whomever you pick,make sure he or she is someone
you can trust to give you honest feedback and suggestions.A cre-
ative mentor and coach can make a big difference in helping im-
prove your creativity skills.

From Jeff Dyer
When we started this project almost ten years ago,I had no idea of
the joyful,but challenging,journey before me.The innovator’s DNA
research has opened my eyes to the fact that all ofus can make cre-
ative contributions towards a better world.

Shifting from home to school,one teacher stands out above
all in terms of unbridled curiosity—J.Bonner Ritchie.I worked
with him intensely during my master’s program,where he single-
handedly rewrote the maps in my mind by constantly confronting
my worldviews.Put simply,Bonner personified the innovator’s
DNA long before we ever put these ideas onto paper.His unsettling
questions, uncanny observations, and unusual dexterity with
metaphor lifted my own sense of inquiry to an entirely different
level.For that gift,Professor Bonner,thank you.

Now I give deep thanks to my incredible coauthors,Jeff and
Clay,for their contributions to this book and to my life.When Jeff
joined BYU, he brought along his father’s “institution builder”
mentality.Jeffnot only worked tirelessly to support colleagues’cre-
ative efforts in the strategy group;he reached beyond the strategy
world to collaborate with me on an experimental MBA class,Cre-
ative Strategic Thinking.We hoped to merge a strategic perspec-
tive on how companies innovate with a psychological perspective
on how individuals innovate.This merger created a perspective-
changing classroom experience that continues on,with Jeffat the
helm.The unexpected side benefit of that course was an increas-
ing level of collaboration around where innovative ideas come
from and how they successfully move forward.Our collaboration
has been powerful,both professionally and personally.Jeff’s capac-
ity to craft clear ideas and to exert discipline onto a project when
it might otherwise drift is exceptional.These gifts proved invalu-
able during a decade that rocked the Gregersen family in many
unexpected and difficult ways.Through it all,Jeff not only kept
the project on track,but even more important,he provided steady
personal support in the midst of difficult life challenges.

of a precursor to the disruptive questions—in a good way—that
Clay would come to pose throughout the project.However,little
did any ofus know that Clay (and his family) would tackle a series
of serious health challenges in the coming years:his heart attack,
then cancer,and then a stroke.Each took a heavy toll on Clay’s
health,and with each he faithfully clawed his way back to well-
being.Through it all,I stand amazed at his capacity to continue
taking on work and to do so with his characteristic kindness.When
I discussed innovator’s DNA ideas with Clay—whether he was in
good health or fighting to recover—he more often than not would
reset a theoretical framework for the book or a chapter that almost
always made it better.His passion for theory and his capacity for
buildinggood theory left indelible marks on the innovator’s DNA.

3081. Probability: 0.9935
No wonder he’s the author of disruptive innovation.Most of all,
Iexpress gratitude to Clay that during his own physical challenges
he still found the time to supply energy-giving support and insight
into my own family’s ups and downs.

Living and traveling with Suzi always includes
unplanned excursions that create wonder,awe,and,at the core,a
restoration ofthe heart.On those journeys it’s inspiring to watch
her completely engaged with sketching and painting her keen
observations of the world.Her counterintuitive take on life and
her deeply intuitive sense of direction are solid anchors in my
sometimes topsy-turvy world.Indeed,“forever and always”have
taken on even deeper meaning as we face the joys and sorrows of
earthly experience (including Suzi’s own experience with breast
cancer).What a gift it is to be married to your best friend.Nothing
better—especially when so much time and energy went into writ-
ing this book.So thank you,Suzi,for joining me on the journey
and infusing it with such joy.I have never seen blue like that before.
