78. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty .

79. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9986
That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there .

80. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968

It's interesting , I like being an editor .

92. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ?

93. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Something like listening to music is a good idea .

94. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well .

95. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing .

96. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ?

97. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9914
That was heaven !

98. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones .

99. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9923
That sounds wonderful .

100. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967

115. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9923
Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself .

116. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
That's wonderful . Congratulations .

117. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
Wow ! It ’ s packed .

150. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
That ’ s great . Where did you stay ?

151. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932

152. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
That sounds great .

153. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun .

hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home .

174. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ?

175. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9958
I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble .

176. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?

177. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943

191. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9913
It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools .

192. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9979
Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness .

193. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money .

194. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it .

195. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9906
That's a good idea.What time is good for you ?

196. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .

197. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9971
That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food .

198. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Good idea .

199. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury .

200. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957

202. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious !

203. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .

204. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?

205. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal .

206. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Hey , that sounds great .

207. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9986
Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin .

208. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade .

209. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
Wow , that looks beautiful .

210. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967
This one looks great ! I love the seashore .

233. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935

234. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day .

Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ?

245. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9922
Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future .

246. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9930
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at .

253. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ?

254. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921
Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ .

255. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ?

That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .

267. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9922
Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .

268. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9902
Let me have a try . The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ...

269. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique .

270. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9936

Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on .

277. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name .

278. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9988
It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life .

279. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937

282. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
That's wonderful ! We've got to celebrate !

My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy .

311. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9984
That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?

312. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9976
well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .

313. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9974
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .

314. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908
really ? that's interesting !

315. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9930

That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .

318. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9965
Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ?

331. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9953

347. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought .

He had great vision , didn't he ?

What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .

359. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9984
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from .

360. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
A match made in heaven .

361. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
It sounds like a really exciting city to live in .

388. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9970
That's a good idea . You are really creative .

389. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954

425. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9925
That's a good idea.Let ' s go !

426. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !

427. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in !

428. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net .

429. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939

433. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9975
So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !

434. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway .

435. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation !

436. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
Come on ! It is really a fun game .

437. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema .

438. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy !

439. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase !

440. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932

441. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9970
I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art !

443. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini .

444. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961

445. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9917
It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ?

446. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905

455. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand .

456. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
Good idea !

457. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that .

458. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954

480. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
Good idea ! Let's make ready , then .

481. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9906
Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this .

482. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .

483. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9920
I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner .

484. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting .

492. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system .

493. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912

500. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9929
Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious .

501. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise .

502. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961

Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off .

511. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939
That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ?

512. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient .

513. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time .

514. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job .

515. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9900
Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on .

516. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
I would look so cool carrying this around !

517. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything .

532. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .

533. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921

534. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9904
Why not ? It sounds great .

535. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938

Wow ! That's a fantastic movie !

539. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9978
That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ?

540. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9970
It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ?

541. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9958
What an amazing goal !

542. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
It was very good . I followed it right to the end .

543. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe !

544. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9982
Great play !

545. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time .

546. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9922
Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works !

547. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !

548. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9974
Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I ’ d say it ’ s really a special art form .

549. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911

Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun !

558. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
Alright . That's a good idea .

559. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9974
Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit .

560. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9980
It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing !

561. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears .

Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .

565. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .

566. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9928
That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ?

567. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9936
Sounds interesting !

They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ...

574. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
That's exciting , man .

575. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9970
There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .

576. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man .

577. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9915
You're so industrious .

578. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on .

Hi , Don . What a surprise !

580. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break .

581. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him !

582. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9914
It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' .

590. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9964
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute .

591. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .

592. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it .

593. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
Good idea . That will help us to warm up .

594. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9915
Pretty good . Where are you going ?

595. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918

Good idea .

600. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
Oh , Mary . You've surprised me !

601. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921
That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now .

602. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river .

You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him !

624. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone .

625. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
Well , imagine that ! How old are you ?

626. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
Oh my gosh , how exciting !

627. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911

Totally cool colors !

632. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948
Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ?

633. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9917
How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus .

634. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there .

635. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9923

655. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9924
How nice .

656. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
Awesome . You'll see that they are really catchy .

657. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
Wow , I have my own bathroom !

Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ?

659. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9977
Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious .

660. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948

661. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
That's terrific !

662. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
There . Now , wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy , we ’ ll ...

663. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ?

Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold .

667. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9906
Wow ! I'm so happy for you .

668. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable .

669. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking .

670. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
It sounds like a really exciting city to live in .

671. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
Great party , isn ’ t it ?

674. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
Marvelous idea ?

675. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9983
I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity .

676. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .

677. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed .

678. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures .

679. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie .

680. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
Wow ! Good timing .

681. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
How nice ! Have fun !

682. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939

683. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9978
that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home .

684. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
I really appreciated it .

685. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway .

686. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation !

687. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again .

688. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
I really appreciated it .

689. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .

690. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
A funny thing happened to me the other day .

691. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks , but it is spacious and bright .

692. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948
Yes , that's a good idea .

693. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
Your way does touch my heart .

694. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
How nice it is here

695. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9947
Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?

696. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9953
Very interesting !

697. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9984
That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful .

698. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908
I'm glad you like it.The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll .

699. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
That's great ! I love to dance to fast music .

700. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .

701. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
oh , that sounds like fun !

702. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
It is really exciting news .

708. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there .

709. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ?

710. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9902
Ta da ! Let's go to the Ritz !

711. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939
I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go .

712. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9964
Yes , it's an amazing drop .

713. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9925
Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us .

714. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
What a brilliant smile !

715. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
That's incredible . I cann't believe it .

716. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
How amazing !

717. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9929
Great !

718. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ?

719. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
It's so interesting , I like it very much .

720. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food !

721. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming !

722. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes .

723. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
That's a good idea .

724. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9915
How nice it is here .

725. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult .

726. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
Ha-ha ! You got me there !

727. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them .

728. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9947
Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .

729. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
You have done excellent work .

730. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
Crazy !

731. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908
That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different .

732. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9964
Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one .

733. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9904
How about a comedy ?

734. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9917
That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ?

735. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9989
I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention !

736. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9970
That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see .

737. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting .

738. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
Good idea . Is there a good movie on ?

739. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Good idea .

740. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9902
It certainly is . It's so much fun .

741. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors .

742. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .

743. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9929
You are so romantic , my sweetheart .

744. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9947
Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?

745. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
Wow , what a lovely cake .

746. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9971
That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .

747. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too .

748. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .

749. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
Well , it is very beautiful .

750. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed .

751. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams !

752. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .

753. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers .

754. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9953
I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting .

755. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
What a good idea !

756. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Fantastic .

757. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
Oh , how wonderful . I ’ ll be glad to .

758. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967
Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go !

759. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9917
Yes . Very wonderful .

760. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9931
That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes .

761. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948
It seems you two bring out the best of one another .

762. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
That's great . Let's go !

763. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Wow .

764. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done .

765. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9983
That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ?

766. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
Full of energy and hope .

767. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award .

768. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9972
That's a great idea !

769. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like !

770. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ...

771. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9970
that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it .

772. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
Wow , what a great burd !

773. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9972
She sure knows how to strut her stuff .

774. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
She's a real turn-on our rights .

775. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9907
And look out she's dressed .

776. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
OK . Great idea !

777. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting .

778. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible .

779. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
That looks like an interesting book .

780. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9976
I like the design of the coat .

781. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ?

782. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
Your garden is really lovely .

783. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
He sounds more like an artist than a businessman .

784. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it .

785. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team .

786. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting .

787. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
It's so beautiful .

788. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it .

789. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
Good idea . That will help us to warm up .

790. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .

791. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax .

792. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play .

793. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
I think the campaign is a blockbuster .

794. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
Hi , Don . What a surprise !

795. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break .

796. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
Hey , that sounds a good idea .

797. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9971
It's instructive and inspiring .

798. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921
Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me .

799. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
Good idea . That might help .

800. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
That sounds like a good idea .

801. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9975
I like that idea .

802. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9947
Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry .

803. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors .

804. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving .

805. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it .

806. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ?

807. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9924
That's a good idea.What ' s on ?

808. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9974
It's such a nice change .

809. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
Sounds interesting .

810. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948
Good idea . Let's goa

811. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss .

812. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9903
Maybe he's gifted in that .

813. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time .

814. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948
Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !

815. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9974
That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it .

816. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
The wonderful passing Melaena did .

817. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9971
Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well .

818. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Oh ... that makes me excited too !

819. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
Yeah . This is a big house with a garden . I like it very much .

820. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
Wow , that sounds great .

821. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
It's fantastic .

822. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play .

823. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9924
Why not ? That's a good idea to help them .

824. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going !

825. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
How beautiful the flower is !

826. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
Really , it's so beautiful .

827. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
I love that vase .

828. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
That's amazing !

829. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9972
Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye .

830. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ?

831. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ?

832. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old .

833. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9915
This dish tastes terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good .

834. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
Wow ! It's just what I wanted !

835. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9929
Hey , great set of wheels .

Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world .

837. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
It is special , isn't it ?

838. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950

882. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
Oh , what a beautiful garden !

1169. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?

1170. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9971
Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities .

1171. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9975
Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives .

1172. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9977
That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university .

Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ?

that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ?

1251. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9924
it sounds interesting . I'll take one .

1252. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9978
Here ’ s an interesting ad

1253. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9920
Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .

1254. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful .

1255. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Well , that's cool .

1256. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .

1257. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
It sounds great . How much is the rent ?

1258. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908
That's great ...

1259. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9920
Good idea . Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan . Besides that , what's your secret ?

1260. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
Wow , how exciting .

1261. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion .

1262. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9972
It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ?

1263. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too .

1264. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
It's very good , and the result isn't too bad .

1265. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9925
Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there !

1266. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on !

1267. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9974
Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess .

1268. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Let's take a roundabout way .

1269. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Good idea .

1270. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together .

1271. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9922
I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea .

1272. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
That's good thinking .

1273. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good .

Very well . We have some fresh red roses .

1275. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909

1279. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ?

1280. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony .

1281. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people .

1282. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ?

1283. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9904
That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising .

1284. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9923
That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him !

1285. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9953
Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ?

1286. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9983
Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?

1287. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !

1288. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9985
This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !

1289. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !

1290. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9981
Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !

1291. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
Wow ! A third more ? Very good .

1292. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916

1293. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
I am a painter .

1294. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
Yes , that one is very nice .

1295. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9907
oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway !

Me , too ! The chips here are so light and crispy .

1297. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9928
Yes , he sings wonderfully .

1298. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
Good idea , let's shop to we drop !

1299. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room .

1300. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .

1301. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9913
I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It ’ s appetizing and tasty .

1302. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Oh , that's quite convenient . Thank you .

1303. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918

I really like that outfit .

1307. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
Those are great . How much were they ?

1308. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
Isn't that great ? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice .

1309. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9964
I especially like this flowery skirts . My fiancee will look very elegant in this .

1310. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9913
Very good . You can pick up your order in one week .

1311. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
That sounds great .

1312. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
It goes all the way there .

1313. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
That's good . You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room .

1314. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ?

1315. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
What a find ! So , how much does it cost ?

1316. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9929
It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card .

1317. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
How nice these sunglasses are !

1318. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ?

1319. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
Great . Good work .

1320. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9987
It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .

1321. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
It looks delicious .

1322. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
That sounds like a good idea .

1323. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908
This is a gift she'll cherish for years . How do you want to pay ?

1324. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9920
Yes , that sounds wonderful .

1325. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Relly ? That's amazing .

1326. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9928
Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun .

1327. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9930
That sounds pretty good .

1328. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
Awesome !

1329. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ?

1330. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9979
Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ?

1331. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
This is a good opportunity .

1332. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9983
Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun .

1333. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9947
It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food .

1334. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
Cool ! Well , let's go over there to join mom . I want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method .

1335. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9914
Sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well .

1336. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9925
Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while .

1337. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
That is an excellent choice , and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner .

1338. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
That sounds perfect .

1339. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9922
Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ?

1340. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9936
That sounds pretty good . Tell me , must we use the same payment method for all of our employees ?

1341. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?

1342. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9976
Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ?

1343. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
Wonderful .

1344. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy .

1345. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9970
You are waltzing quite wonderfully . It's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .

1346. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
Cool !

1347. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9900
That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ?

1348. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9983
Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc .

1349. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
What a good idea !

1350. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
A nice name , isn't it ?

1351. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967
That's wonderful ! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful !

1352. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
4945939 . Marvellous ! Thanks for your help .

1353. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
I like the different instruments that they use .

1354. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
Sure . That's really amazing . However I don't have so much time . Do you have a full day cruise ?

1355. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9977
Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful .

1356. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
It sure looks special , looks expensive too .

1357. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
Those are really cute .

1358. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
that ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?

1359. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9929
Very good . How much does that cost ?

1360. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9903
Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all .

1361. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9931
You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours .

1362. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
I really like how that sounds .

1363. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9928
That's just perfect for me . I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in .

1364. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak .

1365. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939
Sounds like a good idea .

1366. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .

1367. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers .

1368. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
It's a great game . There are a lot of new characters .

1369. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome !

1370. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
I've never seen such good graphics .

1371. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
Terrific !

1372. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ...

1373. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921
That is wonderful .

1374. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901
that's a good idea . I'll call them now . Thanks for your help !

1375. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
I think it's beautiful . I want to hang it in the living room .

1376. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9907
That's the beauty of it — the imperfection .

1377. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
It's interesting . I think I will take the bus tour . By the way , what about the lodging ?

1378. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
We will lodge at the indigenes ' houses . It's interesting .

1379. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me !

1380. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
Sure . This is the one I will not hesitate to recommend . Its color and style is so attractive and also the quality is really reliable .

1381. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
These are beautiful ! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ?

1382. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ?

1383. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more .

1384. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .

1385. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ?

1386. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
This dress is beautiful . May I try it on ?

1387. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9972
Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill .

1388. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ?

1389. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
Really ! I've never seen so much work .

1390. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
That was a pretty good shot , Mary .

1391. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
Thanks.This is fun !

1392. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9953
It's really different , isn't it ?

1393. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9913
That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order .

1394. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9953
Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ?

1395. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .

1396. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
Oh , what a pleasant surprise ! Don't you remember me ?

1397. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
What a good idea !

1398. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9969
Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one .

1399. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
wow ! That ’ s great . Sure , I can . Where is the Human Resources Office ?

1400. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9913
This is a precious opportunity for us and our company .

1401. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro .

1402. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921
It looks great .

1403. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9925
Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn .

1404. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9913
Very good . You can pick up your order in one week .

1405. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
That's great . Will that be cash , check , or credit card ?

Great !

1407. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ?

1408. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9965
Good idea

1409. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
Wow , you're not kidding . Hold on a second . Hello , could you give us a hand , please ?

1410. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9904
This one from Sony gives a very sharp picture .

1411. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9917
I greatly appreciate this .

1412. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
That ’ s a nice dress . It ’ s very smart .

1413. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
That ’ s a lovely hat .

1414. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9900
Well , why don ’ t we make it the thirtieth ? We can set it up from three to five . That way , everybody can just go home afterwards .

1415. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9931
Yes . When I saw the advertisement I thought it would really suit me .

1416. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
Pure gold ones , please . This is so beautiful . I'll take it .

1417. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet .

1418. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9915
Yes . We have all kinds of colors for it .

1419. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9913
That is so thoughtful of you .

1420. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
Looks nice . How much do you charge ?

1421. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
That is a good idea .

1422. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9947
That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ?

1423. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9960
The bracelet is so well suited to you . It looks very nice .

1424. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967
Good idea . My wife has a fine ear for music . I am sure she would like it .

1425. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?

1426. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
Yeah , it's quite cute . I don't think it will fit me . I would prefer a darker color . Have you a black one ?

1427. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
Nice choice .

1428. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
That's beautiful .

1429. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
Yes , it is a new brand .

1430. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
That sounds great .

1431. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908
It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?

1432. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967
That is a wonderful choice .

1433. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9900
It's very nice . I'd like to purchase this refrigerator .

1434. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9915
That ′ s impressive ! What ′ s the sale price ?

1435. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9949
Cool !

1436. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ...

1437. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9982
OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there .

1438. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz .

1439. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9922
That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation .

1440. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting .

1441. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet .

1442. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9907
Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates !

1443. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ...

1444. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9902
That sounds really good to me right now .

1445. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948
Interesting ...

1446. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
That's really special .

1447. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9920
We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .

1448. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
Fabulous . Thanks .

1449. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932

Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .

1515. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908

1516. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
The chicken is also nice .

1517. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9964

1550. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9967
That's great . I'd like to book four single rooms , five double rooms and three suites .

1551. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9901

1794. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9986
Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute .

Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children .

1816. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943

1828. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section .

1829. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
Those are beautiful . Do you have any in a size six ?

1830. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9975

1847. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9981
Ok . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there .

1848. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ?

1849. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9903
It is beautiful .

1850. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9902
Wow . You look great .

1851. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?

1852. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9922
That makes sense . I'm going to try that .

1853. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9955
That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ?

1854. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9964
Wow , a real step up !

1855. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful .

1856. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
People decided to use the blackout to their advantage .

1857. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks !

1858. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .

1859. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?

1860. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
Don't you think it's a bit bright ?

1861. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .

1862. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9982
That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .

1863. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it .

1864. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9906
that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large .

1865. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
that ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .

1866. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9902
Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides .

1867. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
As many as you like , sir . They are beautiful , aren't they ?

1872. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9907
Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ?

1873. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it .

1874. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
Really ? That's wonderful !

1875. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator .

1876. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it .

1877. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9928
There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess .

1878. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ?

1879. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well .

1880. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
What a thoughtful granddad ! Do you have her account details with you ?

1881. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9954
Good idea . Let's go . Where should we go ?

1882. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
Well , that sounds better than giving it up .

1883. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
Well , cool . What's the price for this trip ?

1884. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
What a nice garden ! Look at these tulips !

1885. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable .

1886. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9989
Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me .

1887. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
Yeah , that ’ s a good idea , and you like to cook . What about the books ?

1888. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
It was a great game .

1889. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different .

1890. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ?

1891. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
It can also entertain your passengers like me .

1892. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
And here is Buckingham Palace ! Look , isn't it beautiful ? It is much bigger than I imagined .

1893. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
This is amazing . I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour . So where next ?

1894. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9935
Wonderful .

1895. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Good idea .

1896. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9936
I think that that would work out quite well as an ending for your resume .

1897. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too .

1898. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9915
all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral !

1899. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing .

1900. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
I really love this kind of atmosphere .

1901. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
That's very generous .

1902. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9917
Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ?

1903. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9924
Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ?

that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?

1905. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9925
That sounds like fun .

Really ? That is amazing .

1907. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
Well , I strongly suggest you going to London . It's really charming .

1908. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
It sounds like a good idea .

1909. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9958
What a lovely tapestry ! Don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ?

1910. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style .

1911. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9966
This one , Shogun , looks good .

1912. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9938
I think that that would be a really good choice ! Let's call and make a reservation .

That's good . When can I go to see the house ?

1918. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9931
That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ?

1919. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912

Those flowers are lovely , too .

1921. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life !

1922. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939
You've made a good choice.This china tea set is unusual.It was made in Jingdezhen .

1923. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9925

1924. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9941
That's a good choice .

1925. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9953
That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish .

1926. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9923
It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait !

1927. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9933
That's fantastic . I think I like this one .

1932. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ’ ll take it .

1933. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
That's a good idea .

That's a good idea , Charlotte .

1940. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
Really ? Wow , it is great .

1941. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921
don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ?

1942. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated .

1943. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9973
that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .

1944. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?

1945. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
If I were you , the pyramid would be my first choice . It's so magnificent .

1946. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9906
It's really worth seeing . By the way , I'd like to buy some souvenirs .

1947. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9906
Great .

1948. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9930
it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that .

1949. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9976
Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket .

1950. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9920
Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ?

1951. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
Well , the route 5 is really charming . Must I make a reservation ?

1952. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9936
sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch .

1953. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9937
that's a good idea .

1954. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9921
Oh , it's beautiful .

1955. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages .

You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome !

1957. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere !

1958. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9931
Come on baby , let's dance !

1959. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
That's a good idea .

1960. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9923
Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion .

1961. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
I really love this kind of atmosphere .

1962. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9968
It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient .

1963. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9905
It's seriously good .

1964. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9958
That one will bring you many hours of pleasure .

1965. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
Our silks are known for their quality . They are one of our traditional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand .

1966. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9926
That sounds interesting ! I'll send a fax . As soon as I receive the definite answer , I'll give you a special answer .

1967. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9940
That's a good idea . That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves .

1968. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9952
Good idea .

1969. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted .

1970. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .

1971. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939
It surely is . And the cast is really the best .

1972. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?

1973. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
Terrific . May I stop by to get that two tickets tomorrow afternoon ?

1974. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
Sounds interesting .

1975. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible .

1978. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9951
That's a good idea !

1979. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
That sounds like a good deal .

1980. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect .

1981. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
That sounds very interesting !

1982. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9976
Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ?

1983. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9924
That ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway .

1984. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9981
Good idea . I noticed that on our way to the tower there are so many shops selling all kinds of souvenirs .

1985. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9907
Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ?

1986. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9931
Yes , it almost looks new .

1987. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9912
Very well . We have some fresh red roses .

1988. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
That sounds like a good deal .

1989. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9978
Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences .

1990. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead .

1991. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9958
He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it .

1992. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
I love the paint job !

1993. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9943
What a beautiful home !

1994. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9904
I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street .

1995. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9959
I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen .

1996. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering !

1997. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9962
20 is very colorful and feels nice . I'd like to start with it . Is it pure silk ?

1998. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things .

1999. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942

2001. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
An interesting meeting , isn't it ?

Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ?

2005. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card .

2006. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9936
It smells good . Look at these . They make my mouth watering .

2007. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9919
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .

2008. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9924
That's great . I'll take her .

2009. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9976

Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak .

2015. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university .

2016. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Terrific ! When are you moving in ?

2017. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9927
We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program .

2018. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9980
Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !

2019. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9980
Great idea ! I like authentic Chinese food .

2020. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9903
Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special .

2021. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9963
Wow . That sounds really good .

2022. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9910
That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal .

2023. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9932
Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well .

2024. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9909
Excellent . Have you had French food before ?

2025. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9978
Oh , yes . Marvelous !

2026. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9939
Sounds like a good idea .

2027. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9948
How sweet ... if you make me some more toast , I'll let you use my new retro toaster ...

2028. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9946
Isn't the shape cool ?

2029. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9911
The chicken is also nice .

2030. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9945
I really like the way this house looks .

2031. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9934
Yes , it has great curb appeal .

2032. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9978
The landscaping is wonderful !

2033. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9944
I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls .

2034. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9936
Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink !

2035. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9961
Good idea . Thank you .

2036. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9928
That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ?

2037. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back !

2038. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9942
Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ?

2039. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9956
I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work .

2040. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9908
That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music .

2041. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9916
She's beautiful . What's the price for Digital Barbie ?

2042. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9918
That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .

2043. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9957
It sounds amazing to me .

2044. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9950
Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible .

2045. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9907
Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket .

2046. Estimated Creative Probability: 0.9976
Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport
