 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 

2. Probability: 0.9940
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too .

7. Probability: 0.9728
 Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . 

8. Probability: 0.9749
 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 

9. Probability: 0.9789
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 

10. Probability: 0.9977
 It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . 

11. Probability: 0.9803
 And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . 

12. Probability: 0.9750
 Great , is it a two bedroom house ? 

13. Probability: 0.9852
 No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . 

14. Probability: 0.9978
 That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . 

15. Probability: 0.9863
 I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius .

26. Probability: 0.9851
 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 

27. Probability: 0.9836
 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 

28. Probability: 0.9992
 It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game .

 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 

38. Probability: 0.9899

40. Probability: 0.9775
 OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . 

41. Probability: 0.9989

 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too . 

44. Probability: 0.9974
 excellent ! That sounds like a plan .

48. Probability: 0.9701

50. Probability: 0.9896
 sounds good ! Let's go ! 

51. Probability: 0.9824
 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 

52. Probability: 0.9919
 That's great . What's on tonight ?

 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 

57. Probability: 0.9708
 Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? 

58. Probability: 0.9984
 That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 

59. Probability: 0.9746
 Well , I like playing the violin . 

60. Probability: 0.9972
 That's really interesting . 

61. Probability: 0.9819
 How about football ? 

62. Probability: 0.9906
 For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . 

63. Probability: 0.9898
 Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . 

64. Probability: 0.9837
 I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . 

65. Probability: 0.9934
 Great .

 This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . 

68. Probability: 0.9971
 Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . 

69. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

70. Probability: 0.9794
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 

71. Probability: 0.9827
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 

72. Probability: 0.9984
 Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? 

73. Probability: 0.9956

74. Probability: 0.9747
 Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . 

75. Probability: 0.9718
 I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . 

76. Probability: 0.9727
 Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! 

77. Probability: 0.9758
 You'd like it . 

78. Probability: 0.9898
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . 

79. Probability: 0.9830
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . 

80. Probability: 0.9714
 Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? 

81. Probability: 0.9938
 Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! 

82. Probability: 0.9833
 OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! 

83. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

84. Probability: 0.9958
 You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? 

85. Probability: 0.9772
Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . 

86. Probability: 0.9827
 The beauty under the tree ? 

87. Probability: 0.9830
 It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th 

88. Probability: 0.9801

91. Probability: 0.9935
 come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 

92. Probability: 0.9708
 Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . 

93. Probability: 0.9980
 That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . 

94. Probability: 0.9743
 I really like the straight legs . 

95. Probability: 0.9715
 What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? 

96. Probability: 0.9965
 If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! 

97. Probability: 0.9827
 That's good . Do you live near here ?

 I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering .

 Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . 

105. Probability: 0.9894
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . 

106. Probability: 0.9851
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? 

107. Probability: 0.9937
 I'd enjoy that . 

108. Probability: 0.9841
 We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . 

109. Probability: 0.9972
 That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! 

110. Probability: 0.9862
 I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . 

111. Probability: 0.9974
 It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . 

112. Probability: 0.9890
 Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! 

113. Probability: 0.9750
 Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us .

115. Probability: 0.9731
Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue .

 That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ? 

126. Probability: 0.9879
 Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . 

127. Probability: 0.9888
 I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation . 

128. Probability: 0.9756
 It sure is . 

129. Probability: 0.9805
 I can ’ t wait to go there myself . 

130. Probability: 0.9738
 That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? 

131. Probability: 0.9992
 Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? 

132. Probability: 0.9893
 That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? 

133. Probability: 0.9885
 Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . 

134. Probability: 0.9810
 How do you like this waltz ? 

135. Probability: 0.9888
 It's very nice . 

136. Probability: 0.9791
 May I ask you for a dance ? 

137. Probability: 0.9971
 You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . 

138. Probability: 0.9784
 Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . 

139. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

140. Probability: 0.9722
 Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . 

141. Probability: 0.9950
 Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . 

142. Probability: 0.9985
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 

143. Probability: 0.9898

144. Probability: 0.9903
 This is going to be a major production for you ! 

145. Probability: 0.9842
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 

146. Probability: 0.9883
 I liked it . I thought it was great . 

147. Probability: 0.9747
 Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? 

148. Probability: 0.9880
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? 

149. Probability: 0.9797
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? 

150. Probability: 0.9866
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? 

151. Probability: 0.9798
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 

152. Probability: 0.9786
 Yeah , I can really go for some Chinese food right now . 

153. Probability: 0.9996
 That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant . 

154. Probability: 0.9765
 Spring is a lively season . 

155. Probability: 0.9856
 It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . 

156. Probability: 0.9884
 The bright people will remember it forever . 

157. Probability: 0.9807
 Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . 

158. Probability: 0.9773
 That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . 

159. Probability: 0.9740
 Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . 

160. Probability: 0.9976
 That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . 

161. Probability: 0.9735
 Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . 

162. Probability: 0.9869
 Let's try it ! 

163. Probability: 0.9951
 Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . 

164. Probability: 0.9741
 In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . 

165. Probability: 0.9842
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 

166. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ? 

167. Probability: 0.9785
 Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 . 

168. Probability: 0.9823
 That sounds fine . 

169. Probability: 0.9944
 Well , their team work is well worth learning . 

170. Probability: 0.9856
 Okay , that's good .

175. Probability: 0.9939
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker .

 Yes . 

183. Probability: 0.9945
 Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? 

184. Probability: 0.9927
 It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . 

185. Probability: 0.9856
Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much . 

186. Probability: 0.9969
 Let ’ s go for a joy ride .

 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? 

199. Probability: 0.9758
 Make yourself at home . 

200. Probability: 0.9782
 Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?

 You're dancing so well . 

202. Probability: 0.9956
 You dance beautifully too . 

203. Probability: 0.9899
 It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 

204. Probability: 0.9920
 How about tango ?

 Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?

210. Probability: 0.9804
 do you think that's a good idea ? 

211. Probability: 0.9945
 that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? 

212. Probability: 0.9718
 That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . 

213. Probability: 0.9905
 It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . 

214. Probability: 0.9792
 Sure , let's go to Malibu . 

215. Probability: 0.9758

220. Probability: 0.9773
 How about mileage and gas ? 

221. Probability: 0.9797
 OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . 

222. Probability: 0.9751
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . 

223. Probability: 0.9798
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 

224. Probability: 0.9978
 That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? 

225. Probability: 0.9950
 Yes , it's really wonderful ! 

226. Probability: 0.9816
 Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . 

227. Probability: 0.9900
 that sounds good . 

228. Probability: 0.9778
 I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . 

229. Probability: 0.9898
 A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . 

230. Probability: 0.9824
 Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . 

231. Probability: 0.9927
 Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . 

232. Probability: 0.9832
 Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! 

233. Probability: 0.9724
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? 

234. Probability: 0.9751
 No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... 

235. Probability: 0.9756
 No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... 

236. Probability: 0.9794
 You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas .

 You bet ! 

239. Probability: 0.9774
 Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 

240. Probability: 0.9936
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . 

241. Probability: 0.9937
 I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . 

242. Probability: 0.9974
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! 

243. Probability: 0.9810
Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! 

244. Probability: 0.9962
 Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? 

245. Probability: 0.9768
 Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? 

246. Probability: 0.9959
 I love this art exhibition ! 

247. Probability: 0.9828
 Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . 

248. Probability: 0.9954
 That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . 

249. Probability: 0.9892
 Much better than mine . 

250. Probability: 0.9867
 Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . 

251. Probability: 0.9955
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? 

252. Probability: 0.9878
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! 

253. Probability: 0.9723
 that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . 

254. Probability: 0.9862
 all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . 

255. Probability: 0.9792
 OK , let's have a try . 

256. Probability: 0.9753
 It was a good game , wasn't it ? 

257. Probability: 0.9841
 You shall just take it in surprise . 

258. Probability: 0.9728
 Thanks , Serena . 

259. Probability: 0.9851
I ’ m forming a music band . 

260. Probability: 0.9938
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . 

261. Probability: 0.9840
 Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . 

262. Probability: 0.9765
That is the most beautiful sunset ! 

263. Probability: 0.9947
 Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute . 

264. Probability: 0.9787
 Here is a good place . Let's get out . 

265. Probability: 0.9916
 Wow . We don't get to see this in the city ! 

266. Probability: 0.9980
 Mother Nature is quite an artist . 

267. Probability: 0.9888
 Look behind us at the mountains ! They're reflecting pink ! 

268. Probability: 0.9963
 Amazing . The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere ! 

269. Probability: 0.9890
 Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film ! 

270. Probability: 0.9830
What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ? 

271. Probability: 0.9761
 How about going to the suburbs ? 

272. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

273. Probability: 0.9966
 Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . 

274. Probability: 0.9948
 It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? 

275. Probability: 0.9809
 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . 

276. Probability: 0.9753
 Thank you so much , Lisa ! 

277. Probability: 0.9713
 I appreciate that , thank you . 

278. Probability: 0.9778
 Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . 

279. Probability: 0.9702
 Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . 

280. Probability: 0.9996
 That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . 

281. Probability: 0.9830
I decided to go for this kind of life . 

282. Probability: 0.9854
 Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . 

283. Probability: 0.9984
 That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . 

284. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

285. Probability: 0.9814
 That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . 

286. Probability: 0.9891
 And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . 

287. Probability: 0.9809
 it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . 

288. Probability: 0.9785
 sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . 

289. Probability: 0.9731
 Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . 

290. Probability: 0.9979
 I was playing a joke on you . 

291. Probability: 0.9841
 Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? 

292. Probability: 0.9814
 I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . 

293. Probability: 0.9858
 I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . 

294. Probability: 0.9726
 Very nice . Thank you for your time . 

295. Probability: 0.9863
 Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? 

296. Probability: 0.9983
 Good idea . Thanks a billion . 

297. Probability: 0.9985
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 

298. Probability: 0.9803
 Yes , it's perfect ! 

299. Probability: 0.9831
 He's diving for the gold . 

300. Probability: 0.9721
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! 

301. Probability: 0.9872
 How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? 

302. Probability: 0.9815
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . 

303. Probability: 0.9988
 I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . 

304. Probability: 0.9978
 I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . 

305. Probability: 0.9702
 Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 

306. Probability: 0.9979
 It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 

307. Probability: 0.9915
 That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 

308. Probability: 0.9897
 No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 

309. Probability: 0.9715
 I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? 

310. Probability: 0.9848
 Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . 

311. Probability: 0.9832
 Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . 

312. Probability: 0.9885
 August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? 

313. Probability: 0.9712
 Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . 

314. Probability: 0.9934
 Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . 

315. Probability: 0.9708
 Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . 

316. Probability: 0.9820
 The seats are excellent . We're right in the center . 

317. Probability: 0.9906
 That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . 

318. Probability: 0.9771
 You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . 

319. Probability: 0.9899
 Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle . 

320. Probability: 0.9848
 We should come here more often . 

321. Probability: 0.9846
 What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? 

322. Probability: 0.9953
 I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? 

323. Probability: 0.9886
 Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! 

324. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

325. Probability: 0.9734
Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . 

326. Probability: 0.9941
 It's sounds like fun . 

327. Probability: 0.9796
 I want to try something exciting . 

328. Probability: 0.9946
 It's fun . 

329. Probability: 0.9843
 Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . 

330. Probability: 0.9926
 It's interesting , I like being an editor . 

331. Probability: 0.9851
 That's perfect . I will definitely do well . 

332. Probability: 0.9812
 Let's buy some flowers , and pay her a visit 

333. Probability: 0.9975
 That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? 

334. Probability: 0.9977
 Something like listening to music is a good idea . 

335. Probability: 0.9833
 I think that might work for me as well . 

336. Probability: 0.9740
What a police officer ! 

337. Probability: 0.9783
 Make it three cups . Here comes Harry . 

338. Probability: 0.9863
 I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . 

339. Probability: 0.9706
 Yes , indeed . 

340. Probability: 0.9772
 Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often ? 

341. Probability: 0.9952
 It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . 

342. Probability: 0.9875
 Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . 

343. Probability: 0.9753
 That's better . 

344. Probability: 0.9862
The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . 

345. Probability: 0.9975
 So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? 

346. Probability: 0.9883
 ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? 

347. Probability: 0.9846
 Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . 

348. Probability: 0.9869
 Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . 

349. Probability: 0.9860
 That will be great . 

350. Probability: 0.9876
That was heaven ! 

351. Probability: 0.9814
 Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! 

352. Probability: 0.9824
 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 

353. Probability: 0.9733
 Birds of a feather flock together . 

354. Probability: 0.9864
 Very nice . 

355. Probability: 0.9776
What a surprise meeting you here , Landy . 

356. Probability: 0.9798
 Yes , I enjoyed it very much . 

357. Probability: 0.9701
 That cat . 

358. Probability: 0.9778
 Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too ? 

359. Probability: 0.9718
 Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ? 

360. Probability: 0.9756
 Why don't you sit in the back with me ? 

361. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

362. Probability: 0.9867
 That ’ s a good way to think about it . 

363. Probability: 0.9817
 You can say that . 

364. Probability: 0.9751
 They must have mixed hackers with crackers . 

365. Probability: 0.9764
 That would work for me . 

366. Probability: 0.9955
 That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . 

367. Probability: 0.9747
 That takes talent ... 

368. Probability: 0.9808
 I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . 

369. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

370. Probability: 0.9839
 Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university . 

371. Probability: 0.9720
 A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ? 

372. Probability: 0.9888
 Really ? Congratulations ! 

373. Probability: 0.9701
 Thank you , Paul . 

374. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

375. Probability: 0.9955
 That sounds wonderful . 

376. Probability: 0.9981
 It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ? 

377. Probability: 0.9923
 Wonderful . I ’ m so excited . 

378. Probability: 0.9845
 It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . 

379. Probability: 0.9939
 I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . 

380. Probability: 0.9750
 Sounds good , when ? 

381. Probability: 0.9816
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . 

382. Probability: 0.9954
 Oh , yes . Beautiful . 

383. Probability: 0.9800
 I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . 

384. Probability: 0.9772
 It kept me awake . 

385. Probability: 0.9868
 It kept me awake a couple of hours . 

386. Probability: 0.9949
 I'm at home painting . 

387. Probability: 0.9896
 That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby . 

388. Probability: 0.9738
 He is a teacher , but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time . 

389. Probability: 0.9899
 I am also impressed with the lines in the movie . 

390. Probability: 0.9890
 That's my favorite . 

391. Probability: 0.9718
 You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable ! 

392. Probability: 0.9965
 It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration . 

393. Probability: 0.9747
 Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble . 

394. Probability: 0.9837
 All in all , it will never lose its appeal . 

395. Probability: 0.9934
 Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? 

396. Probability: 0.9747
 Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home . 

397. Probability: 0.9871
 Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . 

398. Probability: 0.9910
 He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . 

399. Probability: 0.9965
 Oh , that's great . I want to try later . 

400. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

401. Probability: 0.9954
 That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ? 

402. Probability: 0.9727
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . 

403. Probability: 0.9821
 And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . 

404. Probability: 0.9744
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . 

405. Probability: 0.9782
 Thank you . I am very excited . 

406. Probability: 0.9953
 It was really an exciting moment . 

407. Probability: 0.9912
 Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . 

408. Probability: 0.9839
 You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . 

409. Probability: 0.9920
 Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . 

410. Probability: 0.9923
 Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? 

411. Probability: 0.9740
 Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . 

412. Probability: 0.9934
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 

413. Probability: 0.9971
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? 

414. Probability: 0.9773
 Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! 

415. Probability: 0.9809
 Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . 

416. Probability: 0.9982
 That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? 

417. Probability: 0.9783
 Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . 

418. Probability: 0.9881
 Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer . 

419. Probability: 0.9716
 Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! 

420. Probability: 0.9702
Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? 

421. Probability: 0.9952
 It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? 

422. Probability: 0.9879
 Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . 

423. Probability: 0.9821
 Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . 

424. Probability: 0.9841
 OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate . 

425. Probability: 0.9869
 Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 

426. Probability: 0.9959
 Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . 

427. Probability: 0.9802
 That's nice . How old are you ? 

428. Probability: 0.9775
Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . 

429. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

430. Probability: 0.9888
 I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . 

431. Probability: 0.9906
 Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . 

432. Probability: 0.9757
Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 

433. Probability: 0.9825
 Okay . It looks like rain . 

434. Probability: 0.9832
 Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . 

435. Probability: 0.9753

Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . 

513. Probability: 0.9704
 Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . 

514. Probability: 0.9965
 She is really something . 

515. Probability: 0.9873
 Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ?

 Actual 1y , it was their idea first . 

524. Probability: 0.9910
 Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? 

525. Probability: 0.9728
 Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? 

526. Probability: 0.9816
 Why not send them short messages ? 

527. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

528. Probability: 0.9798
 Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here .

543. Probability: 0.9802
 Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ?

 Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? 

556. Probability: 0.9719
How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? 

557. Probability: 0.9823
 That sounds fine . 

558. Probability: 0.9864
 No kidding ? 

559. Probability: 0.9716

615. Probability: 0.9893
 Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? 

616. Probability: 0.9711
 Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? 

617. Probability: 0.9744
 Good for you ! What are you doing ? 

618. Probability: 0.9774
 I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun !

 The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? 

664. Probability: 0.9731
 Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? 

665. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

666. Probability: 0.9786
 How about meeting in my office ? 

667. Probability: 0.9758
 That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . 

668. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

669. Probability: 0.9943
 Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice . 

670. Probability: 0.9794
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . 

671. Probability: 0.9989
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? 

672. Probability: 0.9795
 Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? 

673. Probability: 0.9934
 Great . 

674. Probability: 0.9809
 Well , we shall make it a secret between us . 

675. Probability: 0.9889
 Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . 

676. Probability: 0.9922
 Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . 

677. Probability: 0.9899
 Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . 

678. Probability: 0.9820
 What about some drink ? 

679. Probability: 0.9780
I am very proud of John . 

680. Probability: 0.9872
 Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . 

681. Probability: 0.9830
 You dance well . Do you breakdance ? 

682. Probability: 0.9786
 According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . 

683. Probability: 0.9741
 Like disco ? 

684. Probability: 0.9970
 You are witty . 

685. Probability: 0.9703
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? 

686. Probability: 0.9875
 Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . 

687. Probability: 0.9951
 not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . 

688. Probability: 0.9934
 crazy ! 

689. Probability: 0.9800
 That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . 

690. Probability: 0.9959
 PCC is great ! 

691. Probability: 0.9721
 Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . 

692. Probability: 0.9877
 You and Tom also make a great couple . 

693. Probability: 0.9771
 Try to catch this bouquet then . 

694. Probability: 0.9876
 yeah , that's nice . 

695. Probability: 0.9957
 hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . 

696. Probability: 0.9979
 a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? 

697. Probability: 0.9988
 I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 

698. Probability: 0.9710
 The house warming party . 

699. Probability: 0.9842
 Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . 

700. Probability: 0.9925
 Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? 

701. Probability: 0.9970
 Wow , that would be something to look forward to . 

702. Probability: 0.9767
 why not ? I love animals and I love nature . 

703. Probability: 0.9881
 sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . 

704. Probability: 0.9811
 Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . 

705. Probability: 0.9927
 I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . 

706. Probability: 0.9734
 Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? 

707. Probability: 0.9928
 Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . 

708. Probability: 0.9701
 I'm not a very good singer , but I'm a really great dancer ! I love hip hop dancing . 

709. Probability: 0.9970
 Great ! I'll sing , and you can dance in our band . 

710. Probability: 0.9729
 That's more like it . 

711. Probability: 0.9970
 Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . 

712. Probability: 0.9894
 It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! 

713. Probability: 0.9806
 OK , I can do that . 

714. Probability: 0.9770
 What about going to a movie ? 

715. Probability: 0.9731
 OK , let's go to the cinema to see what's on . 

716. Probability: 0.9963
Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 

717. Probability: 0.9973
 Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding . 

718. Probability: 0.9912
 Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday . 

719. Probability: 0.9741
 Thanks . I really appreciate it . Thanks so much . 

720. Probability: 0.9913
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? 

721. Probability: 0.9797
Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? 

722. Probability: 0.9962
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 

723. Probability: 0.9856
 Well . I like the Thorn Birds best . 

724. Probability: 0.9925
 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 

725. Probability: 0.9982
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! 

726. Probability: 0.9800
 That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . 

727. Probability: 0.9983
 Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form . 

728. Probability: 0.9759
 I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan . 

729. Probability: 0.9959
 Really ? Good for you . 

730. Probability: 0.9780
Let ’ s play a game ! 

731. Probability: 0.9792
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? 

732. Probability: 0.9911
 No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! 

733. Probability: 0.9805
 Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! 

734. Probability: 0.9909
 It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 

735. Probability: 0.9763
 If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . 

736. Probability: 0.9715
I really like the record you lent me the other day . 

737. Probability: 0.9821
 I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . 

738. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

739. Probability: 0.9893
 They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . 

740. Probability: 0.9994
 Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . 

741. Probability: 0.9856
 You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? 

742. Probability: 0.9765
 You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . 

743. Probability: 0.9749
 Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? 

744. Probability: 0.9849
 Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? 

745. Probability: 0.9918
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . 

746. Probability: 0.9713
 You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . 

747. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

748. Probability: 0.9749
 No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? 

749. Probability: 0.9927
 That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me . 

750. Probability: 0.9815
Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! 

751. Probability: 0.9983
 But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . 

752. Probability: 0.9734
 Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? 

753. Probability: 0.9911
 Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . 

754. Probability: 0.9806
 How about Sunday then ? 

755. Probability: 0.9820
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . 

756. Probability: 0.9746
 I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! 

757. Probability: 0.9841
 What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . 

758. Probability: 0.9977
 Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . 

759. Probability: 0.9920
 Yes , really . 

760. Probability: 0.9771
 Huh ? 

761. Probability: 0.9891
 It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . 

762. Probability: 0.9834
 Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? 

763. Probability: 0.9967
 That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 

764. Probability: 0.9769
 How about Saturday morning ? 

765. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

766. Probability: 0.9833
 Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . 

767. Probability: 0.9864
 Really ? Can I join it ? 

768. Probability: 0.9964
 I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 

769. Probability: 0.9940
 It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 

770. Probability: 0.9799
Come in , come in ! 

771. Probability: 0.9774
 No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . 

772. Probability: 0.9951
 That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . 

773. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

774. Probability: 0.9810
 It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . 

775. Probability: 0.9935
 Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . 

776. Probability: 0.9901
 You never guess she is going to have a baby . 

777. Probability: 0.9841
 Oh , she is going to be a great mother . 

778. Probability: 0.9856
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 

779. Probability: 0.9856
 Wow , you're not kidding.Hold on a second.Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? 

780. Probability: 0.9965
 Things doing great ! It ’ s funny running into you like this . Smell well , just last week I ran into Matt as well . 

781. Probability: 0.9958
 He ’ s doing well . We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened . 

782. Probability: 0.9727
 Oh yeah ? 

783. Probability: 0.9922
 Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious ! 

784. Probability: 0.9723
 Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ? 

785. Probability: 0.9938
 I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . 

786. Probability: 0.9937
 You made a perfect choice , Jack . 

787. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

788. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

789. Probability: 0.9869
 what about a factory tour ? 

790. Probability: 0.9955
 good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 

791. Probability: 0.9725
 oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 

792. Probability: 0.9972
 If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . 

793. Probability: 0.9779
 Have a try . 

794. Probability: 0.9842
 How about coming with me to meet my American friends ? 

795. Probability: 0.9974
 Hey , that sounds great . 

796. Probability: 0.9759
 Your dentist must be proud of you ! 

797. Probability: 0.9992
 Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . 

798. Probability: 0.9991
 Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . 

799. Probability: 0.9968
 Wow , that looks beautiful . 

800. Probability: 0.9890
 I might try it myself . 

801. Probability: 0.9716
 What about historic festivals ? 

802. Probability: 0.9733
 well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting . 

803. Probability: 0.9732
 Yes . That would be good . 

804. Probability: 0.9841
 Yes , what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end . 

805. Probability: 0.9797
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 

806. Probability: 0.9980
This one looks great ! I love the seashore . 

807. Probability: 0.9819
 And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ? 

808. Probability: 0.9910
 Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things . 

809. Probability: 0.9910
 Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach . 

810. Probability: 0.9757
 Any way , in a word , panda is our friend . 

811. Probability: 0.9775
 Yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous . 

812. Probability: 0.9794
 No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 

813. Probability: 0.9849
 You're promising . Just follow your dream and never give up . 

814. Probability: 0.9966
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 

815. Probability: 0.9929
 Ok , cool . 

816. Probability: 0.9888
Great party , isn ’ t it ? 

817. Probability: 0.9906
 Yeah , really . 

818. Probability: 0.9731
 I want to go to Shanghai , but I also want to visit Hainan . 

819. Probability: 0.9900
What a pin-up she is ! 

820. Probability: 0.9957
 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 

821. Probability: 0.9987
 Great idea ! Here we go ! 

822. Probability: 0.9932
I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . 

823. Probability: 0.9796
I like your new skirt . 

824. Probability: 0.9971
 Yes . It looks terrific ! 

825. Probability: 0.9851
 Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . 

826. Probability: 0.9839
 Yes . I got very excited . 

827. Probability: 0.9950
 Great ! 

828. Probability: 0.9751
 Thank you , Lisa . 

829. Probability: 0.9952
 Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . 

830. Probability: 0.9842
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 

831. Probability: 0.9826
 Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV . 

832. Probability: 0.9926
 I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . 

833. Probability: 0.9778
 Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? 

834. Probability: 0.9940
 Rock'n'Roll , I guess . 

835. Probability: 0.9886
 It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 

836. Probability: 0.9908
 That sounds like fun . Have a good time . 

837. Probability: 0.9918
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . 

838. Probability: 0.9704
 You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some 

839. Probability: 0.9763
 Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . 

840. Probability: 0.9723
 You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . 

841. Probability: 0.9897
 Sounds good ! Let's go ! 

842. Probability: 0.9754
 That's why he's very popular among girls . 

843. Probability: 0.9897
 Good for you . 

844. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

845. Probability: 0.9723
 I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . 

846. Probability: 0.9763
 Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . 

847. Probability: 0.9765
 Wow ! Is it a good car ? 

848. Probability: 0.9708
 Fine , I'll take a taxi . 

849. Probability: 0.9726
 Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening . 

850. Probability: 0.9906
 Ha-ha , see you then . 

851. Probability: 0.9734
 Great , do you need directions to my office ? 

852. Probability: 0.9743
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . 

853. Probability: 0.9985
 Now that ’ s a great idea ! 

854. Probability: 0.9895
 Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . 

855. Probability: 0.9935
 Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much . 

856. Probability: 0.9878
 I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . 

857. Probability: 0.9781
 Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . 

858. Probability: 0.9765
 Kebabs and roast squid . 

859. Probability: 0.9959
 Super ! 

860. Probability: 0.9944
 I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . 

861. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

862. Probability: 0.9842
Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! 

863. Probability: 0.9883
 Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! 

864. Probability: 0.9767
 I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . 

865. Probability: 0.9802
 Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! 

866. Probability: 0.9731
 Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 

867. Probability: 0.9990
 Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . 

868. Probability: 0.9954
 That sounds great ! 

869. Probability: 0.9730
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?

872. Probability: 0.9828

874. Probability: 0.9927
 That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? 

875. Probability: 0.9784
 Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? 

876. Probability: 0.9887
 It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . 

877. Probability: 0.9963
 That ’ s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon . 

878. Probability: 0.9928

914. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

915. Probability: 0.9976
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 

916. Probability: 0.9728
 Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . 

917. Probability: 0.9800
Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? 

918. Probability: 0.9908

 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . 

941. Probability: 0.9797
 You were doing great out there ! 

942. Probability: 0.9986
 C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . 

943. Probability: 0.9702
 I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . 

944. Probability: 0.9955
 Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . 

945. Probability: 0.9728
 Thank you , David . 

946. Probability: 0.9977

I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . 

973. Probability: 0.9728
 That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . 

974. Probability: 0.9928

 I'll go together with you . 

1009. Probability: 0.9796

1092. Probability: 0.9804
 You can say that again ! 

1093. Probability: 0.9867
 It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne ! 

1094. Probability: 0.9901
 Why not ? I've got the rings ready . 

1095. Probability: 0.9957
 Yes ! Let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . That ’ s so exciting . 

1096. Probability: 0.9946
 Yes . Let ’ s sleep on the sand . That ’ s most exciting ! 

1097. Probability: 0.9723
Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ? 

1098. Probability: 0.9758
 Why not . If I were you , I certainly would . 

1099. Probability: 0.9838
 The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though . 

1100. Probability: 0.9787
 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . 

1101. Probability: 0.9984
 Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . 

1102. Probability: 0.9874
 OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful . 

1103. Probability: 0.9789
 Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . 

1104. Probability: 0.9871
 She must have done a lot of work on it . 

1105. Probability: 0.9784
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 

1106. Probability: 0.9859
 Really ? Congratulations . 

1107. Probability: 0.9726
 It sounds like you weren't expecting that . 

1108. Probability: 0.9809

 Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . 

1112. Probability: 0.9993
 My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . 

1113. Probability: 0.9993
 That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 

1114. Probability: 0.9910
 Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . 

1115. Probability: 0.9986
 well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . 

1116. Probability: 0.9982
 I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . 

1117. Probability: 0.9964
 really ? that's interesting ! 

1118. Probability: 0.9837
 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! 

1119. Probability: 0.9963
 That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? 

1120. Probability: 0.9833
 It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . 

1121. Probability: 0.9906
 Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . 

1122. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds good . 

1123. Probability: 0.9799
 Candlelight in the Window 

1124. Probability: 0.9783
 Why don't we go to a concert instead ? 

1125. Probability: 0.9983
 Great idea ! 

1126. Probability: 0.9954
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 

1127. Probability: 0.9759
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 

1128. Probability: 0.9968
 Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? 

1129. Probability: 0.9791
 I went sky-diving !

 That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . 

1135. Probability: 0.9969
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 

1136. Probability: 0.9702

 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . 

1145. Probability: 0.9975
 Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . 

1146. Probability: 0.9722
 Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . 

1147. Probability: 0.9736
 Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . 

1148. Probability: 0.9784
 Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . 

1149. Probability: 0.9984
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . 

1150. Probability: 0.9970
 Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . 

1151. Probability: 0.9911
 Okay , it sounds good .

Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! 

1157. Probability: 0.9805
 I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve . 

1158. Probability: 0.9970
 It's very exciting . I think . 

1159. Probability: 0.9884
 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby !

 Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . 

1184. Probability: 0.9731
 Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 

1185. Probability: 0.9960
 I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job .

1193. Probability: 0.9814
 Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ”

1196. Probability: 0.9885
 Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ”

 Nice ! Let ' s go !

 Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . 

1209. Probability: 0.9831
 I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . 

1210. Probability: 0.9891
 We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . 

1211. Probability: 0.9934
 Great . 

1212. Probability: 0.9790

 The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! 

1224. Probability: 0.9794
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong .

1226. Probability: 0.9771

1246. Probability: 0.9774
 Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . 

1247. Probability: 0.9995
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . 

1248. Probability: 0.9964
 But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . 

1249. Probability: 0.9938
 A match made in heaven . 

1250. Probability: 0.9887
 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls .

 Take your pick , Julie . 

1272. Probability: 0.9764
 Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . 

1273. Probability: 0.9976
 That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ? 

1274. Probability: 0.9936

 Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . 

1296. Probability: 0.9739
 The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . 

1297. Probability: 0.9732
 Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 

1298. Probability: 0.9772
 A gold watch ! 

1299. Probability: 0.9923
 I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . 

1300. Probability: 0.9899
 Good for you , keep it up . 

1301. Probability: 0.9904
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . 

1302. Probability: 0.9754
 Yes , it's to my liking , too . 

1303. Probability: 0.9749
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 

1304. Probability: 0.9803
 Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? 

1305. Probability: 0.9897
 Hehe .. sure 

1306. Probability: 0.9964
 I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 

1307. Probability: 0.9940
 It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 

1308. Probability: 0.9893
Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . 

1309. Probability: 0.9986
 Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . 

1310. Probability: 0.9891
 And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . 

1311. Probability: 0.9785
 Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . 

1312. Probability: 0.9859
Your ring is very beautiful . 

1313. Probability: 0.9780
 Oh , it is precious . 

1314. Probability: 0.9771
 Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival . 

1315. Probability: 0.9775
 We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China . 

1316. Probability: 0.9780
 I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . 

1317. Probability: 0.9908
Great party , isn't it ? 

1318. Probability: 0.9914
 Yeah , really , jane and ted always have great parties . 

1319. Probability: 0.9944
 That's great . We should visit him some time . 

1320. Probability: 0.9784
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 

1321. Probability: 0.9992
 That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 

1322. Probability: 0.9702
 How about a snack after work ? 

1323. Probability: 0.9947
 Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . 

1324. Probability: 0.9907
 It's really going to be fresh all the time . 

1325. Probability: 0.9761
 Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? 

1326. Probability: 0.9892
 Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . 

1327. Probability: 0.9798
 Those young actors play the roles perfectly . 

1328. Probability: 0.9710
 Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . 

1329. Probability: 0.9937
 That ’ s sounds great . 

1330. Probability: 0.9736
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 

1331. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

1332. Probability: 0.9719
 You can say that again . 

1333. Probability: 0.9717
I like your sweater . It suits you very well . 

1334. Probability: 0.9811
 Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . 

1335. Probability: 0.9910
 She certainly has the taste . 

1336. Probability: 0.9950
 Wow ! 

1337. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1338. Probability: 0.9794
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 

1339. Probability: 0.9825
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 

1340. Probability: 0.9801
 You bet . I'm really excited . 

1341. Probability: 0.9813
 I like to play the piano for fun . 

1342. Probability: 0.9914
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 

1343. Probability: 0.9829
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 

1344. Probability: 0.9988
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 

1345. Probability: 0.9945
 It's cool . 

1346. Probability: 0.9751
 All right . Make it a double , will you ? 

1347. Probability: 0.9910
 Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . 

1348. Probability: 0.9731
 Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . 

1349. Probability: 0.9943
 That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . 

1350. Probability: 0.9825
 cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . 

1351. Probability: 0.9703
 Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . 

1352. Probability: 0.9764
 Maybe you'll call his home . 

1353. Probability: 0.9985
 That's a good idea . You are really creative . 

1354. Probability: 0.9881
 Perfect.Couldn ' t be better ! 

1355. Probability: 0.9747
 It's just what I wanted . 

1356. Probability: 0.9857
 I'm really pleased with it.Thanks . 

1357. Probability: 0.9914
 It's super . 

1358. Probability: 0.9955
Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . 

1359. Probability: 0.9790
 Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? 

1360. Probability: 0.9825
Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . 

1361. Probability: 0.9972
 That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 

1362. Probability: 0.9929
 It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? 

1363. Probability: 0.9846
 Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . 

1364. Probability: 0.9950
 That sounds great . 

1365. Probability: 0.9815
 Yes , I'm really excited . 

1366. Probability: 0.9933
 I have an idea . 

1367. Probability: 0.9741
 But we ’ re so right for each other . 

1368. Probability: 0.9821
It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . 

1369. Probability: 0.9787
 A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . 

1370. Probability: 0.9991
 That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . 

1371. Probability: 0.9777
 why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . 

1372. Probability: 0.9967
 Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . 

1373. Probability: 0.9966
 They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . 

1374. Probability: 0.9745
 Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . 

1375. Probability: 0.9954
 That sounds great ! 

1376. Probability: 0.9798
 I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . 

1377. Probability: 0.9909
 Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? 

1378. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

1379. Probability: 0.9833
 We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . 

1380. Probability: 0.9821
 Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . 

1381. Probability: 0.9870
 Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . 

1382. Probability: 0.9790
 I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . 

1383. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1384. Probability: 0.9715
 Good . Thank you for telling me this . 

1385. Probability: 0.9717
 Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . 

1386. Probability: 0.9717
I really admire you , Diana . 

1387. Probability: 0.9893
 seriously ? But you are such a genius . 

1388. Probability: 0.9951
 You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . 

1389. Probability: 0.9906
 I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . 

1390. Probability: 0.9872
 Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . 

1391. Probability: 0.9709
 Yes . Twice . 

1392. Probability: 0.9725
Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? 

1393. Probability: 0.9706
 Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . 

1394. Probability: 0.9736
 Yeah . The autumn is marvelous here . 

1395. Probability: 0.9853
 How about winter ? 

1396. Probability: 0.9970
 It seems a good way . 

1397. Probability: 0.9827
 How about Mac Donald's ? 

1398. Probability: 0.9837
 Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . 

1399. Probability: 0.9942
 You flatter me . 

1400. Probability: 0.9732
 Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? 

1401. Probability: 0.9809
 How about tomorrow night ? 

1402. Probability: 0.9899
 Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ? 

1403. Probability: 0.9903
 How about the Korean restaurant next to it ? 

1404. Probability: 0.9864
 That's great . I would love to . And when ? 

1405. Probability: 0.9984
 Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? 

1406. Probability: 0.9806
 Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? 

1407. Probability: 0.9752
 That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . 

1408. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

1409. Probability: 0.9835
 Couldn't be better . 

1410. Probability: 0.9988
 Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . 

1411. Probability: 0.9871
Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . 

1412. Probability: 0.9938
 Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . 

1413. Probability: 0.9778
 I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 

1414. Probability: 0.9811
 Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 

1415. Probability: 0.9980
 That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . 

1416. Probability: 0.9716
 Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? 

1417. Probability: 0.9846
Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering . 

1418. Probability: 0.9900
What a pin-up she is ! 

1419. Probability: 0.9957
 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 

1420. Probability: 0.9779
 Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics . 

1421. Probability: 0.9945
 Wonderful . 

1422. Probability: 0.9786
 It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . 

1423. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1424. Probability: 0.9909
 Um , that ’ s good . 

1425. Probability: 0.9915
 Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . 

1426. Probability: 0.9880
 Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . 

1427. Probability: 0.9829
 Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . 

1428. Probability: 0.9798
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 

1429. Probability: 0.9882
 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 

1430. Probability: 0.9880
 Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 

1431. Probability: 0.9872
 World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? 

1432. Probability: 0.9769
 I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? 

1433. Probability: 0.9923
 My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . 

1434. Probability: 0.9856
 That's good ! 

1435. Probability: 0.9732
 Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? 

1436. Probability: 0.9952
 He performs very well . He is so funny ! 

1437. Probability: 0.9949
 OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? 

1438. Probability: 0.9994
 Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . 

1439. Probability: 0.9834
 Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . 

1440. Probability: 0.9919
 Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . 

1441. Probability: 0.9859
 So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . 

1442. Probability: 0.9977
 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 

1443. Probability: 0.9781
 Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! 

1444. Probability: 0.9777
 Oh , I'll have a try . 

1445. Probability: 0.9814
 And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . 

1446. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1447. Probability: 0.9839
 No , seriously . I am impressed . 

1448. Probability: 0.9839
 No , seriously . I am impressed . 

1449. Probability: 0.9748
Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? 

1450. Probability: 0.9971
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . 

1451. Probability: 0.9764
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . 

1452. Probability: 0.9766
 Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . 

1453. Probability: 0.9855
 For sure all the customers will benefit from this . 

1454. Probability: 0.9979
 Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? 

1455. Probability: 0.9961
 Sounds like it was meant to be . 

1456. Probability: 0.9869
 Really ? He is so great . 

1457. Probability: 0.9717
 Really ? I want to go , too . 

1458. Probability: 0.9914
 That's great . 

1459. Probability: 0.9710
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . 

1460. Probability: 0.9806
 OK , I can do that . 

1461. Probability: 0.9957
 I think it looks gorgeous . 

1462. Probability: 0.9953
 I honestly think it looks great . 

1463. Probability: 0.9741
 Thanks for doing such a good job . 

1464. Probability: 0.9871
 How about the shelf ? 

1465. Probability: 0.9981
 that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! 

1466. Probability: 0.9896
 It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . 

1467. Probability: 0.9740
 It's huge ! 

1468. Probability: 0.9972
 The craftsmanship is excellent . 

1469. Probability: 0.9703
 Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? 

1470. Probability: 0.9835
 You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . 

1471. Probability: 0.9963
 A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . 

1472. Probability: 0.9917
 OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? 

1473. Probability: 0.9792
 Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten . 

1474. Probability: 0.9894
 That ’ s great . I'd love to . 

1475. Probability: 0.9947
 Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! 

1476. Probability: 0.9917
 Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! 

1477. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds good . 

1478. Probability: 0.9922
 Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . 

1479. Probability: 0.9811
 Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . 

1480. Probability: 0.9817
 That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . 

1481. Probability: 0.9988
 Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . 

1482. Probability: 0.9972
this party rocks ! 

1483. Probability: 0.9911
 I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! 

1484. Probability: 0.9767
 oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? 

1485. Probability: 0.9860
 I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . 

1486. Probability: 0.9798
 Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you . 

1487. Probability: 0.9728
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . 

1488. Probability: 0.9871
 He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . 

1489. Probability: 0.9779
 Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . 

1490. Probability: 0.9961
 Wow ! Good timing . 

1491. Probability: 0.9945
 Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! 

1492. Probability: 0.9906
 Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... 

1493. Probability: 0.9962
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 

1494. Probability: 0.9799
 Well . I like the Thom Birds best . 

1495. Probability: 0.9925
 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 

1496. Probability: 0.9976
 That's a good idea.Let ' s go ! 

1497. Probability: 0.9890
 The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! 

1498. Probability: 0.9946
 Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! 

1499. Probability: 0.9966
 It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . 

1500. Probability: 0.9916
 I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . 

1501. Probability: 0.9853
 Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum .

 see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! 

1503. Probability: 0.9922
 Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . 

1504. Probability: 0.9802
 Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? 

1505. Probability: 0.9889
 Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . 

1506. Probability: 0.9876
 Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . 

1507. Probability: 0.9939
 I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . 

1508. Probability: 0.9876
 Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? 

1509. Probability: 0.9795
 Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . 

1510. Probability: 0.9845
 That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? 

1511. Probability: 0.9909
 How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? 

1512. Probability: 0.9896
 That sounds great . What time should I come over ? 

1513. Probability: 0.9830
 Sounds good . See you there ! 

1514. Probability: 0.9982
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! 

1515. Probability: 0.9764
 Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ? 

1516. Probability: 0.9962
 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 

1517. Probability: 0.9989
 That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 

1518. Probability: 0.9876
 Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? 

1519. Probability: 0.9975
 Come on ! It is really a fun game . 

1520. Probability: 0.9781
 Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . 

1521. Probability: 0.9735
 For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . 

1522. Probability: 0.9985
 Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . 

1523. Probability: 0.9827
 That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? 

1524. Probability: 0.9922
 That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . 

1525. Probability: 0.9795
Wow , is that your sports car ? 

1526. Probability: 0.9804
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 

1527. Probability: 0.9918
 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 

1528. Probability: 0.9984
 It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! 

1529. Probability: 0.9756
 It sure is . 

1530. Probability: 0.9966
 That sounds an interesting job , Bob . 

1531. Probability: 0.9797
Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! 

1532. Probability: 0.9963
 I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! 

1533. Probability: 0.9870
 He seems to win awards everywhere . 

1534. Probability: 0.9769
 He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . 

1535. Probability: 0.9856
 I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' 

1536. Probability: 0.9899
 Good for you , keep it up . 

1537. Probability: 0.9918
 It ’ s great . 

1538. Probability: 0.9832
What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . 

1539. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

1540. Probability: 0.9916
 That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . 

1541. Probability: 0.9983
 Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . 

1542. Probability: 0.9726
 Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! 

1543. Probability: 0.9972
 That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . 

1544. Probability: 0.9831
 actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . 

1545. Probability: 0.9875
 not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . 

1546. Probability: 0.9781
 I'd like that very much . 

1547. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

1548. Probability: 0.9948
 Rock ' n'Roll , I guess . 

1549. Probability: 0.9735
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 

1550. Probability: 0.9723
 Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . 

1551. Probability: 0.9936
 It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? 

1552. Probability: 0.9892
 It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . 

1553. Probability: 0.9848
 Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . 

1554. Probability: 0.9853
 Really ? Maybe I should work for you . 

1555. Probability: 0.9785
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 

1556. Probability: 0.9953
 We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . 

1557. Probability: 0.9770
 Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . 

1558. Probability: 0.9756
 But it went by fast . It was interesting . 

1559. Probability: 0.9842
 I liked it . 

1560. Probability: 0.9797
 Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ? 

1561. Probability: 0.9927
 How sweet . 

1562. Probability: 0.9852
 Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . 

1563. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1564. Probability: 0.9797
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 

1565. Probability: 0.9961
 Yes , it looks interesting . 

1566. Probability: 0.9772
 You're right . I love it very much . 

1567. Probability: 0.9954
 Oh , he had fooled me . 

1568. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1569. Probability: 0.9920
 Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ? 

1570. Probability: 0.9945
 Wonderful . 

1571. Probability: 0.9883
 Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . 

1572. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1573. Probability: 0.9718
 Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? 

1574. Probability: 0.9912
 It ’ s really very good . 

1575. Probability: 0.9873
 Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? 

1576. Probability: 0.9913
 It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood ! 

1577. Probability: 0.9746
 Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining ! 

1578. Probability: 0.9970
 That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! 

1579. Probability: 0.9937
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . 

1580. Probability: 0.9891
 I didn ’ t know you could do that . 

1581. Probability: 0.9880
 How about the Yellow Mountains ? 

1582. Probability: 0.9979
 Good idea ! 

1583. Probability: 0.9929
 What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . 

1584. Probability: 0.9817
 I can do that . 

1585. Probability: 0.9892
 That ’ s great . Thanks a lot . 

1586. Probability: 0.9784
 I want to buy that candy . 

1587. Probability: 0.9733
 My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 

1588. Probability: 0.9910
 Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . 

1589. Probability: 0.9835
 You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? 

1590. Probability: 0.9832
 Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 

1591. Probability: 0.9744
 Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! 

1592. Probability: 0.9977
 Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . 

1593. Probability: 0.9943
 What a thrilling trip ! 

1594. Probability: 0.9901
 Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . 

1595. Probability: 0.9871
 Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . 

1596. Probability: 0.9811
 Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . 

1597. Probability: 0.9713
 Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . 

1598. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

1599. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

1600. Probability: 0.9983
 Fine , they are colorful and tasty . 

1601. Probability: 0.9935
 Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . 

1602. Probability: 0.9825
 How about the dessert ? 

1603. Probability: 0.9892
 I thought it was pretty good . 

1604. Probability: 0.9744
 You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding . 

1605. Probability: 0.9716
 Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 

1606. Probability: 0.9794
 Really ? Thank you . 

1607. Probability: 0.9943
 That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? 

1608. Probability: 0.9827
 Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . 

1609. Probability: 0.9853
 How about winter ? 

1610. Probability: 0.9974
 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . 

1611. Probability: 0.9900
 Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that . 

1612. Probability: 0.9973
 That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ? 

1613. Probability: 0.9983
 Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! 

1614. Probability: 0.9924
 I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . 

1615. Probability: 0.9950
 It is incredible . 

1616. Probability: 0.9727
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . 

1617. Probability: 0.9815
 and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . 

1618. Probability: 0.9814
 I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . 

1619. Probability: 0.9980
 Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! 

1620. Probability: 0.9784
 Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either . 

1621. Probability: 0.9951
That looks like an interesting book . 

1622. Probability: 0.9844
 There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . 

1623. Probability: 0.9896
 Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . 

1624. Probability: 0.9856
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 

1625. Probability: 0.9701
 Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . 

1626. Probability: 0.9743
 Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . 

1627. Probability: 0.9801
 Sure , that would be great . 

1628. Probability: 0.9841
The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year . 

1629. Probability: 0.9978
 Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ... 

1630. Probability: 0.9877
 I'm glad that you can make it . 

1631. Probability: 0.9732
 Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you . 

1632. Probability: 0.9919
 That's great ! 

1633. Probability: 0.9791
 Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called " Good Morning to you " . But later someone added the words " Happy Birthday " to their tune . 

1634. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1635. Probability: 0.9909
 Um , that ’ s good . 

1636. Probability: 0.9858
 No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . 

1637. Probability: 0.9876
 I will . It's most thoughtful of you . 

1638. Probability: 0.9971
 Oh , that sounds great ! 

1639. Probability: 0.9835
 Yes , that would be perfect . 

1640. Probability: 0.9709
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . 

1641. Probability: 0.9970
 Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady . 

1642. Probability: 0.9835
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 

1643. Probability: 0.9788
 Oh , lovely . Where's the wedding going to be ? 

1644. Probability: 0.9969
What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken ! 

1645. Probability: 0.9956
 You have a real talent , Ellen ! 

1646. Probability: 0.9900
 I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know . 

1647. Probability: 0.9746
 Well , I think you should go for our manger . I will call him here . 

1648. Probability: 0.9873
 Great ! I'm having a great time . 

1649. Probability: 0.9931
 Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too . 

1650. Probability: 0.9976
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 

1651. Probability: 0.9961
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 

1652. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

1653. Probability: 0.9780

 Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . 

1657. Probability: 0.9774
 Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? 

1658. Probability: 0.9910
 Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . 

1659. Probability: 0.9936
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you .

 Haha , so you are my E-bf . 

1662. Probability: 0.9985
 Wow ! Blablablabla . . . 

1663. Probability: 0.9931
 I am flying like a bird . 

1664. Probability: 0.9795
 I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . 

1665. Probability: 0.9845
 I have no champagne right now . How about this ? 

1666. Probability: 0.9731
 It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . 

1667. Probability: 0.9737
 C U here , honey . 

1668. Probability: 0.9794
 Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . 

1669. Probability: 0.9720
 it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through 

1670. Probability: 0.9742
 Oh , yes . 

1671. Probability: 0.9927
That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . 

1672. Probability: 0.9887
 I made strawberry shortcake . 

1673. Probability: 0.9940
 Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . 

1674. Probability: 0.9888
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? 

1675. Probability: 0.9841
 It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . 

1676. Probability: 0.9982
 oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . 

1677. Probability: 0.9806
 Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ? 

1678. Probability: 0.9968
 Good idea ! Let's make ready , then . 

1679. Probability: 0.9756
 You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . 

1680. Probability: 0.9780
 All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . 

1681. Probability: 0.9931
Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? 

1682. Probability: 0.9949
 Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this . 

1683. Probability: 0.9793
 on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . 

1684. Probability: 0.9794
How do you like this waltz ? 

1685. Probability: 0.9826
 It's very nice , I like it very much . 

1686. Probability: 0.9834
 Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? 

1687. Probability: 0.9983
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . 

1688. Probability: 0.9904
 I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . 

1689. Probability: 0.9742
 Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? 

1690. Probability: 0.9852
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 

1691. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

1692. Probability: 0.9972
 We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . 

1693. Probability: 0.9954
 Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . 

1694. Probability: 0.9725
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 

1695. Probability: 0.9710
 There is some really good news though ! 

1696. Probability: 0.9759
 Tomorrow morning . Try it . 

1697. Probability: 0.9838
 How about Connecticut ? Where's that ? 

1698. Probability: 0.9770
 Yup . Though the words he used are simple , but the spirit he has conveyed is great . 

1699. Probability: 0.9720
 Absolutely ! 

1700. Probability: 0.9935
 Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! 

1701. Probability: 0.9810
 That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . 

1702. Probability: 0.9871
 How about the shelf ? 

1703. Probability: 0.9789
 What a strange guy ! 

1704. Probability: 0.9718
 Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . 

1705. Probability: 0.9898
 These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? 

1706. Probability: 0.9711
 Thanks , John . 

1707. Probability: 0.9861
This is great , isn't it ? 

1708. Probability: 0.9965
 It's the most fun I've had in years . 

1709. Probability: 0.9926
 We should do this more often . 

1710. Probability: 0.9807
 Yes . What a good job we have done ! 

1711. Probability: 0.9902
 How about giving them to that old man ? 

1712. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

1713. Probability: 0.9898

1715. Probability: 0.9921
 Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? 

1716. Probability: 0.9888
 It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? 

1717. Probability: 0.9770
 Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . 

1718. Probability: 0.9746
 Can I see the rainbow ?

 That's great , see you at seven .

 Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . 

1723. Probability: 0.9846
 Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . 

1724. Probability: 0.9772
 why not ? 

1725. Probability: 0.9724
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?

1727. Probability: 0.9749
 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .

 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 

1748. Probability: 0.9742
 Oh , yes . 

1749. Probability: 0.9776
 What about Saturday ?

 You are so interesting . 

1753. Probability: 0.9748
 You've done a lot , my darling ! 

1754. Probability: 0.9710

 oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . 

1756. Probability: 0.9951
 Well , it looks very nice . 

1757. Probability: 0.9944
 Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks .

 Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . 

1759. Probability: 0.9888
 Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . 

1760. Probability: 0.9723
 What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . 

1761. Probability: 0.9725
 That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? 

1762. Probability: 0.9785
 Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . 

1763. Probability: 0.9943
 Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . 

1764. Probability: 0.9751
 He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . 

1765. Probability: 0.9981
 Let me see it , can I ? This is a good photograph . Who are these people ? 

1766. Probability: 0.9861

 Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! 

1773. Probability: 0.9863
 Cool ! Teach me ! 

1774. Probability: 0.9826
 Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . 

1775. Probability: 0.9891
 That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? 

1776. Probability: 0.9932
 Perfect ! 

1777. Probability: 0.9872
 I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . 

1778. Probability: 0.9860
 Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . 

1779. Probability: 0.9711
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? 

1780. Probability: 0.9738
 In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . 

1781. Probability: 0.9952
 That sounds interesting . 

1782. Probability: 0.9767
 That may be what I ’ m going to do . 

1783. Probability: 0.9702
 How about a snack after work ? 

1784. Probability: 0.9961
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 

1785. Probability: 0.9779

 For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . 

1793. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

1794. Probability: 0.9906
Our philosophy teacher is very humorous . 

1795. Probability: 0.9897
 Good for you . 

1796. Probability: 0.9871
 What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ? 

1797. Probability: 0.9990
 Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . 

1798. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

1799. Probability: 0.9979
 That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? 

1800. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1801. Probability: 0.9861
 Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . 

1802. Probability: 0.9811
 Let ’ s have a try . 

1803. Probability: 0.9972
 Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . 

1804. Probability: 0.9720
 I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . 

1805. Probability: 0.9705
 You bet it ! 

1806. Probability: 0.9983
 That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time . 

1807. Probability: 0.9714
 Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? 

1808. Probability: 0.9802
 Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . 

1809. Probability: 0.9717
 I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! 

1810. Probability: 0.9988
 That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . 

1811. Probability: 0.9919
 Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 

1812. Probability: 0.9802
 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 

1813. Probability: 0.9899
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . 

1814. Probability: 0.9924
 Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . 

1815. Probability: 0.9955
 I would look so cool carrying this around ! 

1816. Probability: 0.9798
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 

1817. Probability: 0.9882
 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 

1818. Probability: 0.9902
 They are beautiful . You did a good job . 

1819. Probability: 0.9913
 As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . 

1820. Probability: 0.9884
 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! 

1821. Probability: 0.9883
 Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . 

1822. Probability: 0.9838
That's a very nice pair of glasses . 

1823. Probability: 0.9905
 Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes . 

1824. Probability: 0.9941
 That's incredible ! 

1825. Probability: 0.9824
 Have you thought about going Dutch ? 

1826. Probability: 0.9953
 Yes ... quite pretty . 

1827. Probability: 0.9965
Whose handset sounds so beautiful 

1828. Probability: 0.9971
 Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? 

1829. Probability: 0.9797
 Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . 

1830. Probability: 0.9766
 Yes , the autumn is marvelous here . 

1831. Probability: 0.9755
 A house warming party ?

 That ’ s a good idea . 

1836. Probability: 0.9887
 Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume !

 Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? 

1838. Probability: 0.9891
 Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . 

1839. Probability: 0.9878
 Good Point ! 

1840. Probability: 0.9749
 I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? 

1841. Probability: 0.9940
 Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . 

1842. Probability: 0.9981
 Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? 

1843. Probability: 0.9883
 Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . 

1844. Probability: 0.9748
 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? 

1845. Probability: 0.9758
 Make yourself at home . 

1846. Probability: 0.9936
 Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . 

1847. Probability: 0.9926
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . 

1848. Probability: 0.9733
Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you . 

1849. Probability: 0.9928
 Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift . 

1850. Probability: 0.9755
 You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? 

1851. Probability: 0.9885
 That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . 

1852. Probability: 0.9801
 I think so . It's turning out to be a great day . 

1853. Probability: 0.9775
The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . 

1854. Probability: 0.9861
 That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 

1855. Probability: 0.9918
 Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 

1856. Probability: 0.9873
 The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 

1857. Probability: 0.9733
 It's made from naturally frozen grapes . 

1858. Probability: 0.9982
 Why not ? It sounds great . 

1859. Probability: 0.9805
 You can always take it again . 

1860. Probability: 0.9963
Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 

1861. Probability: 0.9858
 No , not at all . His examples are really interesting . 

1862. Probability: 0.9724
 Certainly . Let me see.Oh , it's on that shelf . 

1863. Probability: 0.9795
 How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . 

1864. Probability: 0.9710

1865. Probability: 0.9884
 Look , it's starting ! 

1866. Probability: 0.9781
 I'd like that very much . 

1867. Probability: 0.9825
David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! 

1868. Probability: 0.9988
 Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . 

1869. Probability: 0.9968
 Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . 

1870. Probability: 0.9718
Wow ! That's a fantastic movie ! 

1871. Probability: 0.9895
 Yes . I love it , too . 

1872. Probability: 0.9829
 Oh , she is . 

1873. Probability: 0.9764
 You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . 

1874. Probability: 0.9990
 That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ? 

1875. Probability: 0.9749
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 

1876. Probability: 0.9912
 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 

1877. Probability: 0.9706
 Shall we take a chance ? 

1878. Probability: 0.9785
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 

1879. Probability: 0.9794
 I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . 

1880. Probability: 0.9913
 That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . 

1881. Probability: 0.9974
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 

1882. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1883. Probability: 0.9740
 Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . 

1884. Probability: 0.9880
 Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! 

1885. Probability: 0.9825
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores 

1886. Probability: 0.9903
 What an amazing goal ! 

1887. Probability: 0.9927
 It was very good . I followed it right to the end . 

1888. Probability: 0.9704
 At the drop of a hat . 

1889. Probability: 0.9798
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! 

1890. Probability: 0.9913
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! 

1891. Probability: 0.9990
 Great play ! 

1892. Probability: 0.9881
 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 

1893. Probability: 0.9718
 Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . 

1894. Probability: 0.9758
 It's my pleasure . 

1895. Probability: 0.9981
 That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time . 

1896. Probability: 0.9894
 Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! 

1897. Probability: 0.9875
 Ha , she is unstoppable . I'm learning so much from her . 

1898. Probability: 0.9903
 She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight . 

1899. Probability: 0.9735
I have a suggestion . Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ? 

1900. Probability: 0.9954
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 

1901. Probability: 0.9911
 But my Rose is great . 

1902. Probability: 0.9979
 Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I ’ d say it ’ s really a special art form . 

1903. Probability: 0.9823
 I couldn ’ t agree more . Actually , I ’ m a Beijing Opera fan . 

1904. Probability: 0.9959

1907. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

1908. Probability: 0.9802
My disposable contact lenses . They're great for camping ! 

1909. Probability: 0.9937
 Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ? 

1910. Probability: 0.9978
 Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ... 

1911. Probability: 0.9776
 Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? 

1912. Probability: 0.9981
 oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 

1913. Probability: 0.9711
 maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 

1914. Probability: 0.9849
 I like peach blossom , because I like spring . 

1915. Probability: 0.9951
 Peach blossom is really beautiful . 

1916. Probability: 0.9897
 Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! 

1917. Probability: 0.9912
 Oh , why not ? 

1918. Probability: 0.9948
 I think a mountain village is splendid ! 

1919. Probability: 0.9717
 It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . 

1920. Probability: 0.9729
 But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! 

1921. Probability: 0.9941
 Why , this is the most interesting film ! 

1922. Probability: 0.9981
 Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! 

1923. Probability: 0.9849

1924. Probability: 0.9885
 Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? 

1925. Probability: 0.9984
 Alright . That's a good idea . 

1926. Probability: 0.9934
 All right.That sounds more interesting . 

1927. Probability: 0.9851
 That ’ s good . 

1928. Probability: 0.9762
 OK , can I bring a date with me ? 

1929. Probability: 0.9986
 Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . 

1930. Probability: 0.9907
 Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . 

1931. Probability: 0.9975
 It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing ! 

1932. Probability: 0.9973
 Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . 

1933. Probability: 0.9887
Look at what you have done . All thumbs . 

1934. Probability: 0.9854
 No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . 

1935. Probability: 0.9845
 Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . 

1936. Probability: 0.9767
 I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . 

1937. Probability: 0.9855
 I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . 

1938. Probability: 0.9748
 What about sunday ? 

1939. Probability: 0.9901
 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 

1940. Probability: 0.9809
 How about tomorrow night ? 

1941. Probability: 0.9909
Your muscles are a spectacle ! 

1942. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

1943. Probability: 0.9905
You are an eager beaver . 

1944. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

1945. Probability: 0.9963
 That sounds terrific . 

1946. Probability: 0.9975
 No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . 

1947. Probability: 0.9724
 But I always wanted to try it . 

1948. Probability: 0.9961
 Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . 

1949. Probability: 0.9938
 That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 

1950. Probability: 0.9817
 I can do that . 

1951. Probability: 0.9965
 That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 

1952. Probability: 0.9732
 I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? 

1953. Probability: 0.9875
 Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . 

1954. Probability: 0.9753
 That's better . 

1955. Probability: 0.9800
 Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . 

1956. Probability: 0.9960
 Sounds interesting ! 

1957. Probability: 0.9892
 What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . 

1958. Probability: 0.9835
 Couldn't be better . 

1959. Probability: 0.9977
 He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . 

1960. Probability: 0.9849
 Really ? I love eccentric people . 

1961. Probability: 0.9977
 Really ! How fascinating . 

1962. Probability: 0.9714
 I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' 

1963. Probability: 0.9919
 It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . 

1964. Probability: 0.9732
 He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . 

1965. Probability: 0.9976
 He is so humorous . 

1966. Probability: 0.9712
 A little French . 

1967. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

1968. Probability: 0.9973
 Really ? That sounds interesting ! 

1969. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

1970. Probability: 0.9813
 Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun ! 

1971. Probability: 0.9959
 Not a bad idea . 

1972. Probability: 0.9803
 Well , let ’ s see . I ’ d like to go to see the Summer Palace . 

1973. Probability: 0.9740
 It's huge ! 

1974. Probability: 0.9721
 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 

1975. Probability: 0.9879
 are you sure ? We could go Dutch . 

1976. Probability: 0.9731
 Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything 

1977. Probability: 0.9949
 Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . 

1978. Probability: 0.9859
 Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . 

1979. Probability: 0.9969
 They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... 

1980. Probability: 0.9740
 Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ? 

1981. Probability: 0.9972
 That's exciting , man . 

1982. Probability: 0.9981
 There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . 

1983. Probability: 0.9961
 I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . 

1984. Probability: 0.9721
 Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . 

1985. Probability: 0.9877
 You and Tom also make a great couple . 

1986. Probability: 0.9771
 Try to catch this bouquet then . 

1987. Probability: 0.9866
 Oh , that would be very useful . 

1988. Probability: 0.9756
 It sure is . 

1989. Probability: 0.9816
 Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . 

1990. Probability: 0.9881
 You're so industrious . 

1991. Probability: 0.9828
you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . 

1992. Probability: 0.9805
 thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . 

1993. Probability: 0.9793
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute ! 

1994. Probability: 0.9805
 You can always take it again . 

1995. Probability: 0.9831
 Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . 

1996. Probability: 0.9969
 Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on . 

1997. Probability: 0.9912
 It ’ s really very good . 

1998. Probability: 0.9929
 Hi , Don . What a surprise ! 

1999. Probability: 0.9914
 Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . 

2000. Probability: 0.9797
 Yes , very good . 

2001. Probability: 0.9794
 Cinct de mayo ? 

2002. Probability: 0.9753
 Www , man ! 

2003. Probability: 0.9824

2004. Probability: 0.9800
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! 

2005. Probability: 0.9936

2006. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

2007. Probability: 0.9768
 I bet he is . He domed his own life . 

2008. Probability: 0.9793
 Yes , I like it very much . 

2009. Probability: 0.9906
 How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? 

2010. Probability: 0.9891
 It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . 

2011. Probability: 0.9974
 Sounds marvelous . 

2012. Probability: 0.9734
 You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . 

2013. Probability: 0.9937
 Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . 

2014. Probability: 0.9899
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . 

2015. Probability: 0.9915
 Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! 

2016. Probability: 0.9907
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 

2017. Probability: 0.9899
 Sounds nice . 

2018. Probability: 0.9826
 It's very nice , I like it very much . 

2019. Probability: 0.9747
 May I invite you for the first dance ? 

2020. Probability: 0.9706
 In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too . 

2021. Probability: 0.9981
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . 

2022. Probability: 0.9904
 I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . 

2023. Probability: 0.9852
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 

2024. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

2025. Probability: 0.9716
 I want to check this magazine out . 

2026. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2027. Probability: 0.9748
 That's nice of you . 

2028. Probability: 0.9945

2029. Probability: 0.9766
Wow ! Look at the time . lt's about 11 0 ' clock .

 Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ? 

2032. Probability: 0.9731
 it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place . 

2033. Probability: 0.9738
 that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ? 

2034. Probability: 0.9814
 yes.In fact , maybe we could go together . 

2035. Probability: 0.9862
 sounds great . see you then . 

2036. Probability: 0.9974
 Wow , that's great ! 

2037. Probability: 0.9749
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 

2038. Probability: 0.9797
 Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ? 

2039. Probability: 0.9982
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . 

2040. Probability: 0.9954
 Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . 

2041. Probability: 0.9885
 Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? 

2042. Probability: 0.9970
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 

2043. Probability: 0.9973
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 

2044. Probability: 0.9880
 I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . 

2045. Probability: 0.9793
 Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? 

2046. Probability: 0.9920
 Pretty good . Where are you going ? 

2047. Probability: 0.9825
 Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . 

2048. Probability: 0.9872
 Drama . I was an actor for five years after college . 

2049. Probability: 0.9942
 That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ? 

2050. Probability: 0.9936
 Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! 

2051. Probability: 0.9770
 Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! 

2052. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2053. Probability: 0.9993
 Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way . 

2054. Probability: 0.9746
 In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! 

2055. Probability: 0.9772
 Vodka martini ? 

2056. Probability: 0.9705
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 

2057. Probability: 0.9800
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 

2058. Probability: 0.9935
 No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . 

2059. Probability: 0.9950
 Sounds fun . Anyone I know ? 

2060. Probability: 0.9747
 It gives me great satisfaction . 

2061. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

2062. Probability: 0.9719
What a coincidence seeing you here . ! 

2063. Probability: 0.9970
 Oh , Mary . You've surprised me ! 

2064. Probability: 0.9907
 Oh , you have a crush on someone , don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes ! 

2065. Probability: 0.9796
 Let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . It ’ ll help me loosen up . 

2066. Probability: 0.9795
 You bet . I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home . 

2067. Probability: 0.9724
 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 

2068. Probability: 0.9910
 Well , let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 

2069. Probability: 0.9720
 Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . 

2070. Probability: 0.9975
 That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . 

2071. Probability: 0.9840
 Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? 

2072. Probability: 0.9877
 Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . 

2073. Probability: 0.9894
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . 

2074. Probability: 0.9860
Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . 

2075. Probability: 0.9736
 My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . 

2076. Probability: 0.9744
 I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . 

2077. Probability: 0.9928
 Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . 

2078. Probability: 0.9966
 Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! 

2079. Probability: 0.9779
 Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole . 

2080. Probability: 0.9860
 Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet . 

2081. Probability: 0.9855
 Ah ha ! I caught you . Just let me peek . I won't tell anyone . 

2082. Probability: 0.9961
 You can't peek ! This is a surprise . 

2083. Probability: 0.9783
 That's a very good hint . 

2084. Probability: 0.9808
 Sure I can , my treat . 

2085. Probability: 0.9952
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 

2086. Probability: 0.9756
Oh , my god ! 

2087. Probability: 0.9952
 That's the cutest little doll I've ever seen in my life ! 

2088. Probability: 0.9708
 Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . 

2089. Probability: 0.9819
 It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh Eve , so this day has become the Lover's Day . 

2090. Probability: 0.9776
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 

2091. Probability: 0.9741
 Toss a coin to decide then . 

2092. Probability: 0.9963
 Yes , it's really a surprise . How are you ? 

2093. Probability: 0.9979
 Good idea ! 

2094. Probability: 0.9955
 Yes , of course . This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food . 

2095. Probability: 0.9756
 It ’ s my pleasure . Can I get you another glass of champagne ? 

2096. Probability: 0.9821
 Sure , I think that would be possible . Where is the fundraiser ? 

2097. Probability: 0.9760
 I think that would be OK . Who will be driving it ? 

2098. Probability: 0.9884
 Yes , we can do that . Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ? 

2099. Probability: 0.9802
 Very well , thank you .

 Yeah , she is . She is pretty , caring , getting easy-going and she is a great cook . She is a gem . 

2106. Probability: 0.9802
How delicious ! Tender and crisp ! 

2107. Probability: 0.9869
 This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir . 

2108. Probability: 0.9758
 Yes , it's really savory . 

2109. Probability: 0.9834
 Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar . You like this place ?

2111. Probability: 0.9877
 Cool . Thanks . ( Jimmy brings May a glass of orange juice . ) 

2112. Probability: 0.9980
 Interesting . Hey , look over there . The dance floor is already packed with people . Oh , the girl in red dances great . 

2113. Probability: 0.9909
 Yeah , a dancing queen . Wanna go and join them ? 

2114. Probability: 0.9816
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . 

2115. Probability: 0.9966
 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 

2116. Probability: 0.9852
 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 

2117. Probability: 0.9783
 Oh , yes please ! I'd love a gin and tonic . 

2118. Probability: 0.9923
 It's great ! Where did you get the CD ? 

2119. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ? 

2120. Probability: 0.9780
 Why not ? I'd love to ! 

2121. Probability: 0.9914
 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . 

2122. Probability: 0.9956
 Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . 

2123. Probability: 0.9725
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 

2124. Probability: 0.9716
 You bet ! 

2125. Probability: 0.9846
 Yes , that's right . That's very good . 

2126. Probability: 0.9756
 It sure is . 

2127. Probability: 0.9880
 Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! 

2128. Probability: 0.9810
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores . 

2129. Probability: 0.9903
 What an amazing goal ! 

2130. Probability: 0.9910
 Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . 

2131. Probability: 0.9936
 That's great . M OST of my family is coming home too . 

2132. Probability: 0.9896
 Our family is a little different . We go to church on Christmas Eve instead . 

2133. Probability: 0.9716
 If you wait a minute I can go with you . 

2134. Probability: 0.9964
Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there !

2136. Probability: 0.9777

2137. Probability: 0.9800
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! 

2138. Probability: 0.9936
 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! 

2139. Probability: 0.9850
 That ’ s great ! I think they do you a lot of good . 

2140. Probability: 0.9979
 That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . 

2141. Probability: 0.9700
 Oh right ... How about Sunday ? 

2142. Probability: 0.9836
 Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok . 

2143. Probability: 0.9824
 I suppose they're playing games . 

2144. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

2145. Probability: 0.9945
 Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? 

2146. Probability: 0.9966
 Oh my gosh , how exciting ! 

2147. Probability: 0.9863
 Sure , I will . How can I miss that ? 

2148. Probability: 0.9827
 Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror ! 

2149. Probability: 0.9948
 It sounds interesting . 

2150. Probability: 0.9939
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 

2151. Probability: 0.9743
 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 

2152. Probability: 0.9975
 Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all . 

2153. Probability: 0.9903
 That's not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 

2154. Probability: 0.9872
He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . 

2155. Probability: 0.9832
 He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . 

2156. Probability: 0.9835
Look ! There's even a built-in handle to carry it with . 

2157. Probability: 0.9898
 Totally cool colors ! 

2158. Probability: 0.9966
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 

2159. Probability: 0.9929
 Ok , cool . 

2160. Probability: 0.9796
 Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ? 

2161. Probability: 0.9847
 Yes , It's very great . 

2162. Probability: 0.9906
 Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet . 

2163. Probability: 0.9782
 French dressing , please . 

2164. Probability: 0.9856
 Oh , French dressing . 

2165. Probability: 0.9941
 Really ! 

2166. Probability: 0.9797
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 

2167. Probability: 0.9933
 How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . 

2168. Probability: 0.9975
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . 

2169. Probability: 0.9793
 Yeah , the air is really fresh . 

2170. Probability: 0.9855
 I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . 

2171. Probability: 0.9725
 Then what about spring ? 

2172. Probability: 0.9812
 Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . 

2173. Probability: 0.9813
 Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? 

2174. Probability: 0.9891
 Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend . 

2175. Probability: 0.9913
 Good job ! This is going to be a great night ! 

2176. Probability: 0.9726
 I think so too.Let ' s go ! 

2177. Probability: 0.9858
 You have to do something romantic . 

2178. Probability: 0.9796
 Yeah , absolutely ! 

2179. Probability: 0.9758
 Of course . I can eat a horse now . 

2180. Probability: 0.9714
 Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ? 

2181. Probability: 0.9915
What a beautiful sweater ! 

2182. Probability: 0.9956
 Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants . 

2183. Probability: 0.9859
 You won't believe it , but it was really cheap . 

2184. Probability: 0.9983
 Oh , that's fantastic ! 

2185. Probability: 0.9717
 But he seems to be very happy with Rose . 

2186. Probability: 0.9955
Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive . 

2187. Probability: 0.9734
 Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive . 

2188. Probability: 0.9899
 Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! 

2189. Probability: 0.9811
 Fine ! 

2190. Probability: 0.9937
Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing ! 

2191. Probability: 0.9961
 You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good ! 

2192. Probability: 0.9875
 Cool ! I wish I could have been there ! 

2193. Probability: 0.9871
 Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 

2194. Probability: 0.9953
 That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 

2195. Probability: 0.9714
 I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? 

2196. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

2197. Probability: 0.9856
 A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . 

2198. Probability: 0.9900
 Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? 

2199. Probability: 0.9932
 Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night . 

2200. Probability: 0.9740
 Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! 

2201. Probability: 0.9978
 Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . 

2202. Probability: 0.9932
 That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . 

2203. Probability: 0.9905
 He sure is ! 

2204. Probability: 0.9826
Don ’ t you think that ’ s good idea to hold a party outside ? 

2205. Probability: 0.9793
 How about going to a concert ? 

2206. Probability: 0.9884
 That ’ s should be fun . 

2207. Probability: 0.9776
 What about Saturday ? 

2208. Probability: 0.9715
 Yes , I found a very good job down there . 

2209. Probability: 0.9749
 oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . 

2210. Probability: 0.9875
 Congratulations . That's great ! 

2211. Probability: 0.9907
 I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . 

2212. Probability: 0.9869
 Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? 

2213. Probability: 0.9976
 That sounds like a good idea . 

2214. Probability: 0.9907
 You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . 

2215. Probability: 0.9710
 Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there . 

2216. Probability: 0.9759
 I couldn ’ t have been any happier ! 

2217. Probability: 0.9860
 That will be great . 

2218. Probability: 0.9919
 That's great ! 

2219. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

2220. Probability: 0.9903
 Thank you . That ’ s perfect timing . 

2221. Probability: 0.9872
Her dress looks funny . 

2222. Probability: 0.9845
 Great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ? 

2223. Probability: 0.9869
 Oh . it ‘ s a case flowers . It ’ s very kind of you . 

2224. Probability: 0.9794
 That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . 

2225. Probability: 0.9888
 No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . 

2226. Probability: 0.9826
 What a lucky man . 

2227. Probability: 0.9719
 You can say that again . 

2228. Probability: 0.9995
 yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? 

2229. Probability: 0.9785
 Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . 

2230. Probability: 0.9748
 Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . 

2231. Probability: 0.9719
 No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? 

2232. Probability: 0.9881
 And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! 

2233. Probability: 0.9944
 Wow . 

2234. Probability: 0.9792
 See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . 

2235. Probability: 0.9719
No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ? 

2236. Probability: 0.9914
 That's great . 

2237. Probability: 0.9786
 That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job . 

2238. Probability: 0.9710
 I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you . 

2239. Probability: 0.9872
 Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me . 

2240. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

2241. Probability: 0.9701
 Maybe I could have a try . 

2242. Probability: 0.9832
Whoa . Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer . 

2243. Probability: 0.9918
 They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . 

2244. Probability: 0.9982
 Wow , they really went to town on this place ! 

2245. Probability: 0.9807
 Quite a difference , huh ? 

2246. Probability: 0.9733
 Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . 

2247. Probability: 0.9740
 Much better today . 

2248. Probability: 0.9938
 Oh , how adorable ! She's got your eyes . 

2249. Probability: 0.9823
 Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? 

2250. Probability: 0.9984
 that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . 

2251. Probability: 0.9900
 You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 

2252. Probability: 0.9923
 Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . 

2253. Probability: 0.9761
 Yeah . I really like Lesley . 

2254. Probability: 0.9946
 That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show . 

2255. Probability: 0.9701
 Sure ! 

2256. Probability: 0.9802
 Sure . Do you want to go first , Sally ? 

2257. Probability: 0.9910
 Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures . 

2258. Probability: 0.9709
 Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer . 

2259. Probability: 0.9948
 Sounds great . 

2260. Probability: 0.9929
 How nice . 

2261. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

2262. Probability: 0.9895
I think Andy's party will be fun . 

2263. Probability: 0.9835
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 

2264. Probability: 0.9858
 OK , I'm going to get iTunes and download some Vanilla Ice songs . 

2265. Probability: 0.9972
 Awesome . You'll see that they are really catchy . 

2266. Probability: 0.9878
 Wow , I have my own bathroom ! 

2267. Probability: 0.9881
 Kind of . It leads to my bedroom . 

2268. Probability: 0.9954
 Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ? 

2269. Probability: 0.9707
 Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine . 

2270. Probability: 0.9782
 I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed . 

2271. Probability: 0.9869
 You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet . 

2272. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2273. Probability: 0.9990
Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious . 

2274. Probability: 0.9921
 Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . 

2275. Probability: 0.9891
 I really appreciate it . 

2276. Probability: 0.9977
 Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? 

2277. Probability: 0.9955
 That's terrific ! 

2278. Probability: 0.9750
 Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . 

2279. Probability: 0.9884
 It's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . 

2280. Probability: 0.9789
 It says , Zina , I like how you rhumba . An admirer . 

2281. Probability: 0.9939
 There . Now , wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy , we ’ ll ... 

2282. Probability: 0.9880
 That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie . 

2283. Probability: 0.9835
 Oh good . 

2284. Probability: 0.9897
 Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need . 

2285. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

2286. Probability: 0.9831
 OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! 

2287. Probability: 0.9951
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 

2288. Probability: 0.9754
 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 

2289. Probability: 0.9837
 Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? 

2290. Probability: 0.9783
I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . 

2291. Probability: 0.9765
 Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . 

2292. Probability: 0.9950
This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ? 

2293. Probability: 0.9741
 Actually , my mother made it from scratch . 

2294. Probability: 0.9809
 In some way , she is more modern . 

2295. Probability: 0.9835
 Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . 

2296. Probability: 0.9995
 A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! 

2297. Probability: 0.9954
 Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . 

2298. Probability: 0.9985
 He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . 

2299. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

2300. Probability: 0.9865
 Wow ! I'm so happy for you . 

2301. Probability: 0.9901
 You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! 

2302. Probability: 0.9858
 Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . 

2303. Probability: 0.9905
 Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . 

2304. Probability: 0.9725
 Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends . 

2305. Probability: 0.9749
 Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . 

2306. Probability: 0.9892
 It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . 

2307. Probability: 0.9740
 That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce . 

2308. Probability: 0.9956
 I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable . 

2309. Probability: 0.9747
 She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye . 

2310. Probability: 0.9985
 Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . 

2311. Probability: 0.9837
 Really ? Oh , thank Goodness ! 

2312. Probability: 0.9794
 Well , if not gymnastics , then mountain biking . 

2313. Probability: 0.9887
 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 

2314. Probability: 0.9945
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . 

2315. Probability: 0.9888
Great party , isn ’ t it ? 

2316. Probability: 0.9906
 Yeah , really . 

2317. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2318. Probability: 0.9862
 They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! 

2319. Probability: 0.9898
 Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . 

2320. Probability: 0.9851
 What about beer ? 

2321. Probability: 0.9972
 That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? 

2322. Probability: 0.9758
 Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? 

2323. Probability: 0.9972
 congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! 

2324. Probability: 0.9734
 ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . 

2325. Probability: 0.9785
 we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! 

2326. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

2327. Probability: 0.9820
 Say , how about a walk along the river ? 

2328. Probability: 0.9972
 Marvelous idea ? 

2329. Probability: 0.9708
 What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ? 

2330. Probability: 0.9984
I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . 

2331. Probability: 0.9977
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . 

2332. Probability: 0.9793
 Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . 

2333. Probability: 0.9908
 Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . 

2334. Probability: 0.9928
 You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . 

2335. Probability: 0.9977
 It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . 

2336. Probability: 0.9838
 Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . 

2337. Probability: 0.9961
 Wow ! Good timing . 

2338. Probability: 0.9922
 How nice ! Have fun ! 

2339. Probability: 0.9838
 Hum ... 

2340. Probability: 0.9951
 Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . 

2341. Probability: 0.9741
 In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . 

2342. Probability: 0.9842
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?

2347. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

2348. Probability: 0.9962

2349. Probability: 0.9983
 that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation !

2358. Probability: 0.9759
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable .

2372. Probability: 0.9831
 Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . 

2373. Probability: 0.9969
 Very interesting ! 

2374. Probability: 0.9752
 How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . 

2375. Probability: 0.9993
 That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . 

2376. Probability: 0.9938
 I'm glad you like it.The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll .

2381. Probability: 0.9862
 Sure . That would be great . 

2382. Probability: 0.9781
 First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .

 I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . 

2384. Probability: 0.9810
 Ok . That sounds like a deal . 

2385. Probability: 0.9939
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 

2386. Probability: 0.9872
 And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself . 

2387. Probability: 0.9905
 what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? 

2388. Probability: 0.9943
 okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . 

2389. Probability: 0.9858
 maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make 

2390. Probability: 0.9973
 oh , that sounds like fun ! 

2391. Probability: 0.9800
 Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . 

2392. Probability: 0.9945
It is really exciting news . 

2393. Probability: 0.9745
 Ok , I'll try that . 

2394. Probability: 0.9887
Do you want to hear a funny joke ?

 OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . 

2396. Probability: 0.9991
 Oh , that's funny ! 

2397. Probability: 0.9705
 Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . 

2398. Probability: 0.9792
 Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? 

2399. Probability: 0.9793
 How about going to the theatre ? 

2400. Probability: 0.9713
 I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you .

2421. Probability: 0.9889
 Ta da ! Let's go to the Ritz !

 Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ? 

2424. Probability: 0.9916

2425. Probability: 0.9853
 Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum .

2445. Probability: 0.9963
 It's so interesting , I like it very much . 

2446. Probability: 0.9937
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! 

2447. Probability: 0.9974
 This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! 

2448. Probability: 0.9881
Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on . 

2449. Probability: 0.9938
 Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . 

2450. Probability: 0.9778
 I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 

2451. Probability: 0.9811
 Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 

2452. Probability: 0.9986
 That's a good idea . 

2453. Probability: 0.9778
How nice it is here . 

2454. Probability: 0.9744
 Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . 

2455. Probability: 0.9767
 Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time . 

2456. Probability: 0.9896
 Great , let ’ s go ! 

2457. Probability: 0.9856
 You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ? 

2458. Probability: 0.9877
 But you did it and did it well ! 

2459. Probability: 0.9967
 It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . 

2460. Probability: 0.9758
 They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . 

2461. Probability: 0.9962
 Ha-ha ! You got me there ! 

2462. Probability: 0.9863
 No joke ! 

2463. Probability: 0.9984
 That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . 

2464. Probability: 0.9950
 Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . 

2465. Probability: 0.9951
 You have done excellent work . 

2466. Probability: 0.9934
 Really ? I've already opened it . Great ! And it is exactly after my fancy . Thank you very much . 

2467. Probability: 0.9886
 Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too . 

2468. Probability: 0.9963
 Crazy ! 

2469. Probability: 0.9842

2471. Probability: 0.9880
 Very good , What's on ? 

2472. Probability: 0.9802
 Umm . . . That's the spirit ! 

2473. Probability: 0.9844
 I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . 

2474. Probability: 0.9745
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! 

2475. Probability: 0.9919
 I ’ ll drink to that ! 

2476. Probability: 0.9923
 Well , we could see something different like a detective film . 

2477. Probability: 0.9948
 How about a comedy ? 

2478. Probability: 0.9852
 How about a love story then ? 

2479. Probability: 0.9735
 Let's go to see a war movie , shall we ? 

2480. Probability: 0.9779
 How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . 

2481. Probability: 0.9940
 That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? 

2482. Probability: 0.9725
 Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . 

2483. Probability: 0.9732
 Coco Lee . 

2484. Probability: 0.9891
 How about transom ? 

2485. Probability: 0.9836
 I love it here . 

2486. Probability: 0.9850
 Huh ? Me ? 

2487. Probability: 0.9994
 I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! 

2488. Probability: 0.9930
 But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . 

2489. Probability: 0.9975
 That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see . 

2490. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds good . 

2491. Probability: 0.9927
 Let's plan a surprise party for him ! 

2492. Probability: 0.9762
 Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? 

2493. Probability: 0.9832
 That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! 

2494. Probability: 0.9972
 That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting . 

2495. Probability: 0.9986
 Good idea . Is there a good movie on ? 

2496. Probability: 0.9773
 What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time . 

2497. Probability: 0.9798
Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . 

2498. Probability: 0.9924
 No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ? 

2499. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

2500. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

2501. Probability: 0.9810
 That sounds nice . Where did you go ? 

2502. Probability: 0.9834

 Good . 

2512. Probability: 0.9952
 Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors . 

2513. Probability: 0.9807
 It sure is.The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . 

2514. Probability: 0.9927
 It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . 

2515. Probability: 0.9926
 You are so romantic , my sweetheart . 

2516. Probability: 0.9820
 No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet . 

2517. Probability: 0.9984
 Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? 

2518. Probability: 0.9831
 Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . 

2519. Probability: 0.9709
 Maybe we can come here again next summer . 

2520. Probability: 0.9765
Here comes the birthday cake . 

2521. Probability: 0.9965
 Wow , what a lovely cake . 

2522. Probability: 0.9721
 There ’ s a possibility . What do you say ? 

2523. Probability: 0.9790
 That ’ s not a bad idea . Bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee . 

2524. Probability: 0.9992
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 

2525. Probability: 0.9972
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 

2526. Probability: 0.9731
 Good . Let's go now . 

2527. Probability: 0.9886
 That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .

 We enjoy it too ! 

2530. Probability: 0.9941
 Well , it is very beautiful . 

2531. Probability: 0.9953

 Why not ? 

2533. Probability: 0.9984
 thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams !

 Oh , OK . That's a nice name , Nandu . And where are you from ? 

2535. Probability: 0.9806
 That's good . Maybe you'll get promoted . 

2536. Probability: 0.9902
 But to me it's really enjoyable . 

2537. Probability: 0.9731
 Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . 

2538. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

2539. Probability: 0.9822
 Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there . 

2540. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

2541. Probability: 0.9705
 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . 

2542. Probability: 0.9975
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . 

2543. Probability: 0.9931
 Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . 

2544. Probability: 0.9865

2555. Probability: 0.9730
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?

2557. Probability: 0.9822
 How about summer ? 

2558. Probability: 0.9970
 Fantastic . 

2559. Probability: 0.9717
 Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . 

2560. Probability: 0.9800
 What about six ? 

2561. Probability: 0.9932
 OK . Let's make it . 

2562. Probability: 0.9725

2633. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes .

2647. Probability: 0.9896
 Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . 

2648. Probability: 0.9752
 According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ? 

2649. Probability: 0.9751
 Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . 

2650. Probability: 0.9835

2659. Probability: 0.9764
 And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses . 

2660. Probability: 0.9906
 He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses . 

2661. Probability: 0.9981
 He sounds more like an artist than a businessman . 

2662. Probability: 0.9947
 To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . 

2663. Probability: 0.9773
 Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ?

Balista , pull me a ristretto . 

2676. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2677. Probability: 0.9970
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 

2678. Probability: 0.9973
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 

2679. Probability: 0.9781

2684. Probability: 0.9829
 How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ? 

2685. Probability: 0.9963
 I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . 

2686. Probability: 0.9890
 And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . 

2687. Probability: 0.9958
 What ? No kidding ! 

2688. Probability: 0.9715
 Yes , she's a professional climber . 

2689. Probability: 0.9778

 How about going to Joe's Restaurant . 

2698. Probability: 0.9983
 Hey , that sounds a good idea . 

2699. Probability: 0.9984
 It's instructive and inspiring . 

2700. Probability: 0.9838
 Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . 

2701. Probability: 0.9849
 That sounds good . I've missed you my friend . 

2702. Probability: 0.9872
 Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . 

2703. Probability: 0.9951
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . 

2704. Probability: 0.9864
 Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch .

2709. Probability: 0.9923
 Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ? 

2710. Probability: 0.9988
 I like that idea . 

2711. Probability: 0.9959
 That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ? 

2712. Probability: 0.9885
 Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 

2713. Probability: 0.9944
 Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 

2714. Probability: 0.9914
 How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? 

2715. Probability: 0.9960
 It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . 

2716. Probability: 0.9876
 Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . 

2717. Probability: 0.9872
 The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . 

2718. Probability: 0.9887
 It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . 

2719. Probability: 0.9937

2726. Probability: 0.9978
 That's a good idea.What ' s on ? 

2727. Probability: 0.9792
 How about going to English corner with me ?

2740. Probability: 0.9921
 Maybe he's gifted in that . 

2741. Probability: 0.9959
 Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . 

2742. Probability: 0.9914
 That's great . 

2743. Probability: 0.9954
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! 

2744. Probability: 0.9881
I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting .

 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it .

2782. Probability: 0.9880
 Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . 

2783. Probability: 0.9948
 Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! 

2784. Probability: 0.9762
 Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ? 

2785. Probability: 0.9818
How beautiful the flower is ! 

2786. Probability: 0.9961
 Really , it's so beautiful . 

2787. Probability: 0.9816
 It's a private garden . 

2788. Probability: 0.9973
I love that vase . 

2789. Probability: 0.9870
 Yes , it looks perfect . 

2790. Probability: 0.9948
 That's amazing ! 

2791. Probability: 0.9734
 Gosh ! 

2792. Probability: 0.9839
 That's good . 

2793. Probability: 0.9850
 Well , flying kites is more fun to me . 

2794. Probability: 0.9711
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? 

2795. Probability: 0.9737
 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 

2796. Probability: 0.9906
People are funny . 

2797. Probability: 0.9719
 They sure are . 

2798. Probability: 0.9796
 Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S . 

2799. Probability: 0.9797
 Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . 

2800. Probability: 0.9973
 Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . 

2801. Probability: 0.9724
 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 

2802. Probability: 0.9936
 It ’ s big and exciting but noisy . 

2803. Probability: 0.9951
 He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? 

2804. Probability: 0.9905
 Yes , that sounds right for me . 

2805. Probability: 0.9946
I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? 

2806. Probability: 0.9900
 They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . 

2807. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2808. Probability: 0.9839
 What if I said no ? 

2809. Probability: 0.9851
 Yes , please . That is very kind of you . 

2810. Probability: 0.9785
 Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? 

2811. Probability: 0.9802
Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . 

2812. Probability: 0.9874
 This dish tastes terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good . 

2813. Probability: 0.9705
 Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers ! 

2814. Probability: 0.9702
 Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine ! 

2815. Probability: 0.9920
 Wow ! It's just what I wanted ! 

2816. Probability: 0.9916
 Hey , great set of wheels . 

2817. Probability: 0.9977
 Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . 

2818. Probability: 0.9919
 It is special , isn't it ? 

2819. Probability: 0.9970
 Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? 

2820. Probability: 0.9899
 I can imagine . 

2821. Probability: 0.9912
 Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . 

2822. Probability: 0.9728
 let ’ s go together . 

2823. Probability: 0.9729
 Well , I'll try gin and tonic . 

2824. Probability: 0.9890
My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? 

2825. Probability: 0.9975
 You sneak ! 

2826. Probability: 0.9884
 I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him ! 

2827. Probability: 0.9794
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . 

2828. Probability: 0.9989
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? 

2829. Probability: 0.9795
 Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? 

2830. Probability: 0.9701
 Ok , count me in . 

2831. Probability: 0.9862
 Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? 

2832. Probability: 0.9750
 Let me have a try . 

2833. Probability: 0.9899
 Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party .. 

2834. Probability: 0.9843
 Yes , it's my favorite . 

2835. Probability: 0.9979
 Oh , it's a disco . Let's dance . 

2836. Probability: 0.9928
 You're a good dancer . 

2837. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

2838. Probability: 0.9805
 Great . We'll go and have a try . Thank you very much . 

2839. Probability: 0.9869
 I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that . 

2840. Probability: 0.9979
 Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ? 

2841. Probability: 0.9774
 Well how about meeting at my place ? 

2842. Probability: 0.9786
 That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . 

2843. Probability: 0.9716
 Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 

2844. Probability: 0.9712
 Let's do it . 

2845. Probability: 0.9746
 Oh , lovely.Where ' s the wedding going to be ? 

2846. Probability: 0.9710
 Thank you , Peter . 

2847. Probability: 0.9977
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 

2848. Probability: 0.9776
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 

2849. Probability: 0.9741
 Toss a coin to decide then . 

2850. Probability: 0.9820
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 

2851. Probability: 0.9717
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 

2852. Probability: 0.9974
 Ah ! That sounds interesting . 

2853. Probability: 0.9882
 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 

2854. Probability: 0.9843
 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 

2855. Probability: 0.9966
 Cool ! 

2856. Probability: 0.9920
 I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... 

2857. Probability: 0.9969
 But I think it's fantastic and charming . Well , you have your opinion and I have mine . 

2858. Probability: 0.9743
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 

2859. Probability: 0.9751
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 

2860. Probability: 0.9954
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 

2861. Probability: 0.9983
 That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake . 

2862. Probability: 0.9946
 Oh , great ! 

2863. Probability: 0.9741
 Yes . In fact , I think it's much better than this week's No . 1 . 

2864. Probability: 0.9890
 Really ? But it's my favorite . 

2865. Probability: 0.9966
 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ? 

2866. Probability: 0.9957
 Wow ! Sure ! 

2867. Probability: 0.9828
 Why not just give them money in red envelopes ? That would be much easier . 

2868. Probability: 0.9844
 I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . 

2869. Probability: 0.9745
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! 

2870. Probability: 0.9919
 I ’ ll drink to that ! 

2871. Probability: 0.9877
 Great , thank you . 

2872. Probability: 0.9739
 Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... 

2873. Probability: 0.9706
 yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . 

2874. Probability: 0.9838
 great ! Thank you ! 

2875. Probability: 0.9797
 that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . 

2876. Probability: 0.9729
 that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . 

2877. Probability: 0.9845
 well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . 

2878. Probability: 0.9767
 Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding . 

2879. Probability: 0.9776
 It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . 

2880. Probability: 0.9993
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 

2881. Probability: 0.9869
 That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . 

2882. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

2883. Probability: 0.9983
 Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . 

2884. Probability: 0.9777
 She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . 

2885. Probability: 0.9997
 Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . 

2886. Probability: 0.9971
 Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? 

2887. Probability: 0.9715
 Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . 

2888. Probability: 0.9899
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . 

2889. Probability: 0.9915
 Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! 

2890. Probability: 0.9718
 Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . 

2891. Probability: 0.9984
 She is a clever mother . 

2892. Probability: 0.9839
 sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? 

2893. Probability: 0.9800
Tom's new business will do well . 

2894. Probability: 0.9712
 It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . 

2895. Probability: 0.9927
 Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out ! 

2896. Probability: 0.9767
 You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . 

2897. Probability: 0.9734
 Gosh ! 

2898. Probability: 0.9839
 That's good . 

2899. Probability: 0.9815
Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps . 

2900. Probability: 0.9771
Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . 

2901. Probability: 0.9894
 It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . 

2902. Probability: 0.9980
 Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 

2903. Probability: 0.9818
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 

2904. Probability: 0.9984
 That's a good idea ! 

2905. Probability: 0.9727
 Oh yeah ? 

2906. Probability: 0.9816
 Look at this one.It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 

2907. Probability: 0.9935
 I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves 

2908. Probability: 0.9773
 Good . I totally agree with what you did . 

2909. Probability: 0.9831
 Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . 

2910. Probability: 0.9702
 I can believe that . 

2911. Probability: 0.9717
 Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . 

2912. Probability: 0.9720
 Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . 

2913. Probability: 0.9910
 That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . 

2914. Probability: 0.9750
 Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe . 

2915. Probability: 0.9990
 That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . 

2916. Probability: 0.9717
 Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . 

2917. Probability: 0.9784
 Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car . 

2918. Probability: 0.9731
 It's so nice of you . You really make my day . 

2919. Probability: 0.9743
 Oh , here's a little token of my affection . 

2920. Probability: 0.9955
An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 

2921. Probability: 0.9800
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 

2922. Probability: 0.9859
 Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 

2923. Probability: 0.9851
 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 

2924. Probability: 0.9836
 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 

2925. Probability: 0.9992
 It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . 

2926. Probability: 0.9770
 Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . 

2927. Probability: 0.9969
 I think it's the most successful film in scene-setting and music . 

2928. Probability: 0.9949
 Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ? 

2929. Probability: 0.9868
 Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches . 

2930. Probability: 0.9756
 Let's switch the lights on . 

2931. Probability: 0.9920
 Sure , great effect.My weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120 . 

2932. Probability: 0.9890
 Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . 

2933. Probability: 0.9797
You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . 

2934. Probability: 0.9941
 That's amazing . 

2935. Probability: 0.9946
 It's beautiful . 

2936. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2937. Probability: 0.9804
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 

2938. Probability: 0.9820
 There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 

2939. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

2940. Probability: 0.9782
 Great . What do you think of it ? 

2941. Probability: 0.9919
 Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . 

2942. Probability: 0.9958
 It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? 

2943. Probability: 0.9711
 Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . 

2944. Probability: 0.9937
 The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . 

2945. Probability: 0.9874
 I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . 

2946. Probability: 0.9938
 I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . 

2947. Probability: 0.9870
 That ’ s great . Thank you so much . 

2948. Probability: 0.9956
 That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? 

2949. Probability: 0.9891
 We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . 

2950. Probability: 0.9915
 Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there . 

2951. Probability: 0.9906
 Yeah , that's nice . 

2952. Probability: 0.9965
 Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . 

2953. Probability: 0.9982
 A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? 

2954. Probability: 0.9988
 I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 

2955. Probability: 0.9802
 Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? 

2956. Probability: 0.9878
Oh , what a beautiful garden ! 

2957. Probability: 0.9709
 Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends . 

2958. Probability: 0.9872
 Oh , my god . A diamond brooch . It's so beautiful . You're so kind to me , A . Thank you ! 

2959. Probability: 0.9733
 Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ? 

2960. Probability: 0.9850
 This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night . 

2961. Probability: 0.9890
You look like being on cloud nine . 

2962. Probability: 0.9925
 She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . 

2963. Probability: 0.9718
 I guess it was fate working to bring you together . 

2964. Probability: 0.9794
 Cinct de mayo ? 

2965. Probability: 0.9753
 Www , man ! 

2966. Probability: 0.9824
 Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 

2967. Probability: 0.9830
 On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems . 

2968. Probability: 0.9764
 That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . 

2969. Probability: 0.9903
 That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . 

2970. Probability: 0.9901
 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 

2971. Probability: 0.9809
 How about tomorrow night ? 

2972. Probability: 0.9924
 I really appreciated it . 

2973. Probability: 0.9948
 Sounds great 

2974. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

2975. Probability: 0.9709
 Yes . I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake . 

2976. Probability: 0.9777
 Well , bring him along to . We will have a great time this weekend . 

2977. Probability: 0.9891
 That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! 

2978. Probability: 0.9721
 Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . 

2979. Probability: 0.9982
 Wow , my son is so clever . 

2980. Probability: 0.9845
 No kidding . So tell me what's your favorite color ? 

2981. Probability: 0.9778
 I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman . 

2982. Probability: 0.9915
 OK , superman . Put on your cape , we are going to fly home . 

2983. Probability: 0.9939
 Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? 

2984. Probability: 0.9885
 She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? 

2985. Probability: 0.9934
 Good for you , Leslie ! 

2986. Probability: 0.9804
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 

2987. Probability: 0.9776
 Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? 

2988. Probability: 0.9976
 Sounds like a good idea . 

2989. Probability: 0.9936
 That could be interesting . 

2990. Probability: 0.9827
 I've never thought about it like that before . 

2991. Probability: 0.9846

3200. Probability: 0.9792
 Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . 

3201. Probability: 0.9734
 Fishing . It's great fun . 

3202. Probability: 0.9767
 Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . 

3203. Probability: 0.9707
 Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . 

3204. Probability: 0.9954
 Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . 

3205. Probability: 0.9717
I really admire you , Diana . 

3206. Probability: 0.9887
 Seriously ? But you are such a genius . 

3207. Probability: 0.9720
 You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . 

3208. Probability: 0.9782
 Yes , it's much better than yesterday . 

3209. Probability: 0.9981
 That sounds like a great idea ! 

3210. Probability: 0.9743
 That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? 

3211. Probability: 0.9907
Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . 

3212. Probability: 0.9931
 I am flattered . 

3213. Probability: 0.9747
Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ? 

3214. Probability: 0.9743
 Of course Mike . Who else ? We fell in love at first sight . 

3215. Probability: 0.9863
 Pretty good , thanks . And you ? 

3216. Probability: 0.9892
 I thought it was pretty good . 

3217. Probability: 0.9847
 Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . 

3218. Probability: 0.9853
 Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that ! 

3219. Probability: 0.9768
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 

3220. Probability: 0.9955
 I like that joke , but I hope it's true . 

3221. Probability: 0.9919
 I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . 

3222. Probability: 0.9782
 Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 

3223. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3224. Probability: 0.9739
 I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . 

3225. Probability: 0.9913
 Actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! 

3226. Probability: 0.9899
 I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . 

3227. Probability: 0.9908
 That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? 

3228. Probability: 0.9810
 Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ? 

3229. Probability: 0.9874
 Wow , this thing can haul . 

3230. Probability: 0.9938
 I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . 

3231. Probability: 0.9937
 You made a perfect choice , Jack . 

3232. Probability: 0.9928
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! 

3233. Probability: 0.9867
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! 

3234. Probability: 0.9835
 Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? 

3235. Probability: 0.9779
 Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . 

3236. Probability: 0.9958
 Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? 

3237. Probability: 0.9704
 Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? 

3238. Probability: 0.9726
 So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . 

3239. Probability: 0.9757
 I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . 

3240. Probability: 0.9706
 Um . It ’ s delicious . 

3241. Probability: 0.9744
How about going swimming ? 

3242. Probability: 0.9803
 Why not ? China is a wonderful country . 

3243. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3244. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

3245. Probability: 0.9750
 I'm very glad to meet you . May I have this dance with you ? 

3246. Probability: 0.9740
 Certainly ! I suppose you dance often . 

3247. Probability: 0.9909
 No , I don't often dance . Isn't this a wonderful party ? 

3248. Probability: 0.9888
 I like it very much . 

3249. Probability: 0.9966
 You dance beautifully . 

3250. Probability: 0.9922
 A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . 

3251. Probability: 0.9989
 Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures . 

3252. Probability: 0.9784
 Maybe we should try a thai massage too . 

3253. Probability: 0.9951
 Well , it looks very nice . 

3254. Probability: 0.9785
 Pop . It's Maria Carey . 

3255. Probability: 0.9983
 Yes , that's a good idea . 

3256. Probability: 0.9774
 Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment . 

3257. Probability: 0.9988
 What an idea ! 

3258. Probability: 0.9887
 Cool , give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud . 

3259. Probability: 0.9836
 Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks . 

3260. Probability: 0.9913
 Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn . 

3261. Probability: 0.9837
 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 

3262. Probability: 0.9879
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 

3263. Probability: 0.9711
 Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . 

3264. Probability: 0.9812
 Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? 

3265. Probability: 0.9747
 How about drinks ? 

3266. Probability: 0.9706
 My pleasure , see you tomorrow evening . 

3267. Probability: 0.9833
 You bet . You should try it yourself . 

3268. Probability: 0.9969
 It was exciting ! 

3269. Probability: 0.9872
 And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself . 

3270. Probability: 0.9745
 Darned right I would ! 

3271. Probability: 0.9824
I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting . 

3272. Probability: 0.9812
 Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too . Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing , too . 

3273. Probability: 0.9856
 I think they're playing Lord of the Rings 

3274. Probability: 0.9944
 That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that . 

3275. Probability: 0.9780
 How about at the subway entrance . 

3276. Probability: 0.9899
 That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 

3277. Probability: 0.9778
 Positive 。 

3278. Probability: 0.9944
 Oh , yes , it was very interesting . 

3279. Probability: 0.9752
the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . 

3280. Probability: 0.9815
 that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 

3281. Probability: 0.9844
 excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 

3282. Probability: 0.9712
 the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 

3283. Probability: 0.9978
 why not ? It sounds great . 

3284. Probability: 0.9780
 cheers . 

3285. Probability: 0.9896
 Why not ? I'd love to do that . 

3286. Probability: 0.9880
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 

3287. Probability: 0.9756
 I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . 

3288. Probability: 0.9767
 Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? 

3289. Probability: 0.9735
 Yes , let's do it . 

3290. Probability: 0.9924
Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . 

3291. Probability: 0.9786
 Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . 

3292. Probability: 0.9930
 Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . 

3293. Probability: 0.9942
 Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . 

3294. Probability: 0.9972
 It was fun , I tell you . 

3295. Probability: 0.9702
 Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight ! 

3296. Probability: 0.9751
 Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . 

3297. Probability: 0.9756
 But , I want to ride it , Daddy . 

3298. Probability: 0.9870
 Ok , I guess it's worthy of two yuan . 

3299. Probability: 0.9870
 Great . Let's go . 

3300. Probability: 0.9789
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?

3303. Probability: 0.9705
 Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? 

3304. Probability: 0.9791
 Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us . 

3305. Probability: 0.9933
I've never met anyone like Clyde before . 

3306. Probability: 0.9784
 He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party . 

3307. Probability: 0.9816
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . 

3308. Probability: 0.9762
 Canada , china , and the use are huge too . 

3309. Probability: 0.9848
Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? 

3310. Probability: 0.9968
 I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It's appetizing and tasty . 

3311. Probability: 0.9952
 Sounds great ! 

3312. Probability: 0.9923
 That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation . 

3313. Probability: 0.9726
 Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip . 

3314. Probability: 0.9819
 Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? 

3315. Probability: 0.9772
 That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . 

3316. Probability: 0.9857
 I appreciate that . 

3317. Probability: 0.9870
That's a cool jacket . Where did you get it ? 

3318. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

3319. Probability: 0.9793
What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress ! 

3320. Probability: 0.9815
 Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . 

3321. Probability: 0.9828
 It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . 

3322. Probability: 0.9754
 That's quite a compliment coming from you . 

3323. Probability: 0.9985
 To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . 

3324. Probability: 0.9825
 Well , we'd better go to a musical comedy next time . I think the one we saw last month was very good . 

3325. Probability: 0.9980
 Yes , they had constant changes of scene , and I love variety . 

3326. Probability: 0.9706
 He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . 

3327. Probability: 0.9879
 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ? 

3328. Probability: 0.9976
 Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ? 

3329. Probability: 0.9876
 Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . 

3330. Probability: 0.9803
 Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together . 

3331. Probability: 0.9863
 You did ? that is great ! 

3332. Probability: 0.9779
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 

3333. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3334. Probability: 0.9794
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 

3335. Probability: 0.9825
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 

3336. Probability: 0.9906
 Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? 

3337. Probability: 0.9869
 Sounds pleasant . 

3338. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

3339. Probability: 0.9787
 That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? 

3340. Probability: 0.9964
 Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . 

3341. Probability: 0.9986
 Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . 

3342. Probability: 0.9802
 Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . 

3343. Probability: 0.9895
 Sure , more elegant and taller . 

3344. Probability: 0.9942
 If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . 

3345. Probability: 0.9928
 Perfect ! Couldn't be better . 

3346. Probability: 0.9879

3347. Probability: 0.9914
 It's super . 

3348. Probability: 0.9764

3349. Probability: 0.9970
 Dream on ! 

3350. Probability: 0.9937
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . 

3351. Probability: 0.9804

3352. Probability: 0.9747
 It gives me great satisfaction .

3358. Probability: 0.9836
 Sure.That would be great.Good luck . 

3359. Probability: 0.9793
 It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week . 

3360. Probability: 0.9896
 Well ... I saw it only once , but for the next two months when I talked to people , I pretended I was the Terminator . 

3361. Probability: 0.9758
 That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? 

3362. Probability: 0.9719
 No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . 

3363. Probability: 0.9777
 They name it after the place where it was first held . 

3364. Probability: 0.9865
 This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . 

3365. Probability: 0.9746
 Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . 

3366. Probability: 0.9749
 Well , that's for all . Excellent ! 

3367. Probability: 0.9726
 That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . 

3368. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

3369. Probability: 0.9839
 But if I were you , I would be a singer . You've got such a beautiful voice . 

3370. Probability: 0.9899
 That's incredible . I can't believe it . 

3371. Probability: 0.9969
 How amazing ! 

3372. Probability: 0.9908
 Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . 

3373. Probability: 0.9866
 Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas . 

3374. Probability: 0.9827
 Steven Spielberg . Another superstar . 

3375. Probability: 0.9990
 It tells a romantic and humorous love story . 

3376. Probability: 0.9925
 This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . 

3377. Probability: 0.9991

3380. Probability: 0.9960
 Really ? It sounds interesting . 

3381. Probability: 0.9849
 Great . I ’ m looking forward to it . 

3382. Probability: 0.9844
 I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! 

3383. Probability: 0.9752
 But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke 

3384. Probability: 0.9839
 That's good . 

3385. Probability: 0.9966
 I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ? 

3386. Probability: 0.9790
 How about Joining our summer camp next week ? 

3387. Probability: 0.9904
 Great ! I can't wait . 

3388. Probability: 0.9861
 Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too . 

3389. Probability: 0.9700
I wonder if I could possibly borrow two bikes from the shop tomorrow ? I ’ ll take actual care of them . I promise you . 

3390. Probability: 0.9791
 Oh , that ’ s all right . It ’ s very kind of you . Can I come around now ? 

3391. Probability: 0.9721
 Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? 

3392. Probability: 0.9985
 That's a good idea . You are really creative .

 Good . Thanks for asking . 

3396. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

3397. Probability: 0.9872
 Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . 

3398. Probability: 0.9951
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . 

3399. Probability: 0.9864
 Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . 

3400. Probability: 0.9791
 She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it !

 I am really proud of you . 

3418. Probability: 0.9820
 Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead . 

3419. Probability: 0.9904
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . 

3420. Probability: 0.9754
 Yes , it's to my liking , too . 

3421. Probability: 0.9749
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 

3422. Probability: 0.9936
 I see . So great . 

3423. Probability: 0.9765
What a good day ! 

3424. Probability: 0.9852
 Great , let's go . 

3425. Probability: 0.9759
 Wow , what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery . 

3426. Probability: 0.9817
 En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it . 

3427. Probability: 0.9830
 I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey . 

3428. Probability: 0.9921
 that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . 

3429. Probability: 0.9956
 yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! 

3430. Probability: 0.9929
 I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! 

3431. Probability: 0.9961
 that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . 

3432. Probability: 0.9937
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! 

3433. Probability: 0.9974
 This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! 

3434. Probability: 0.9910
 According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . 

3435. Probability: 0.9706
 That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . 

3436. Probability: 0.9859
 That's great ! Congratulations . 

3437. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

3438. Probability: 0.9726
 It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 

3439. Probability: 0.9701
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! 

3440. Probability: 0.9827
Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus . 

3441. Probability: 0.9924
 That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs . 

3442. Probability: 0.9719
 I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . 

3443. Probability: 0.9825
 yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 

3444. Probability: 0.9944
 that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 

3445. Probability: 0.9736
 My love will grow , like a river to flow . 

3446. Probability: 0.9874
 Aha , Aha ... 

3447. Probability: 0.9779
 Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . 

3448. Probability: 0.9770
 So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . 

3449. Probability: 0.9976
 That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? 

3450. Probability: 0.9705
 Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . 

3451. Probability: 0.9979
 Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . 

3452. Probability: 0.9978
 Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? 

3453. Probability: 0.9897
 Cedar is a good choice . 

3454. Probability: 0.9941
 It's sounds like fun .

 Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . 

3458. Probability: 0.9950
 That looks great , but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I . D . 

3459. Probability: 0.9909
 Well , this looks nice . Do you know how to use it ? 

3460. Probability: 0.9952
 That sounds interesting . 

3461. Probability: 0.9875
 I like to paint .  

3462. Probability: 0.9734
 Great . Now can I check out this book ? 

3463. Probability: 0.9928
 Well , pretty good . 

3464. Probability: 0.9962
 That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . 

3465. Probability: 0.9915
 That's pretty advanced . 

3466. Probability: 0.9981
 That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . 

3467. Probability: 0.9811
 Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . 

3468. Probability: 0.9771
 Let's do it this way . I'll take him to your place this Saturday . Then you two can make a schedule . 

3469. Probability: 0.9844
 Great . By the way , what does your friend do ? 

3470. Probability: 0.9965
Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . 

3471. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . 

3472. Probability: 0.9701
 Thank you , Paul . 

3473. Probability: 0.9820
 I can hardly believe it . 

3474. Probability: 0.9893
How about going to dance this evening , Jane ? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting ! 

3475. Probability: 0.9991
 Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ? 

3476. Probability: 0.9930
 Yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music . 

3477. Probability: 0.9739
 Listen , it is waltz . I like the elegant step of the old styles . 

3478. Probability: 0.9760
 ( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully ! 

3479. Probability: 0.9905
 That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? 

3480. Probability: 0.9901
But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out . 

3481. Probability: 0.9707
 Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men . 

3482. Probability: 0.9859
 Yeah , she is so charming . I like her , too . 

3483. Probability: 0.9897
That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . 

3484. Probability: 0.9778
 They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . 

3485. Probability: 0.9748
 Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . 

3486. Probability: 0.9919
 That's great ! 

3487. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ? 

3488. Probability: 0.9836
 How about the Classical Music Club ? 

3489. Probability: 0.9871
 Hey-how about the Cinema Club ? 

3490. Probability: 0.9908
 Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! 

3491. Probability: 0.9904
 Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ? 

3492. Probability: 0.9748
Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? 

3493. Probability: 0.9786
 Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . 

3494. Probability: 0.9971
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . 

3495. Probability: 0.9764
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . 

3496. Probability: 0.9796
 Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . For sure all the customers will benefit from this . 

3497. Probability: 0.9985
 That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . 

3498. Probability: 0.9910
 It's worth the time . 

3499. Probability: 0.9974
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 

3500. Probability: 0.9727
 You're right . Let's ask her to give us one more week . 

3501. Probability: 0.9832
 Oh ! yes 

3502. Probability: 0.9890
 So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . 

3503. Probability: 0.9851
 Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . 

3504. Probability: 0.9944
 That's interesting . Go on ! 

3505. Probability: 0.9740
 Great minds think alike . 

3506. Probability: 0.9853
 Pretty good . Please continue . 

3507. Probability: 0.9706
 You bet . I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago . 

3508. Probability: 0.9950
 Wow ! 

3509. Probability: 0.9897
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . 

3510. Probability: 0.9738
 Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . 

3511. Probability: 0.9876
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . 

3512. Probability: 0.9706
 Hey ! 

3513. Probability: 0.9824
 Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . 

3514. Probability: 0.9709
 Maybe I'll be the one . 

3515. Probability: 0.9985
And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant ! 

3516. Probability: 0.9930
 Gee , that's really nice of you . 

3517. Probability: 0.9928
 Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ?

 Great . I'll call and make reservations . 

3519. Probability: 0.9749
 Great . Talk to you then . 

3520. Probability: 0.9918
 Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . 

3521. Probability: 0.9976
 That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . 

3522. Probability: 0.9936
 That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? 

3523. Probability: 0.9892
 Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation .

 Sure . But I still liked it . 

3526. Probability: 0.9976
 Really ? That ’ s marvelous ! 

3527. Probability: 0.9966
 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 

3528. Probability: 0.9852
 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 

3529. Probability: 0.9743
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . 

3530. Probability: 0.9985
 Now that ’ s a great idea ! 

3531. Probability: 0.9979
 Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ? 

3532. Probability: 0.9870
 How about Great Canyon ? 

3533. Probability: 0.9951
 Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . 

3534. Probability: 0.9837
 Oh , good ! We can all get together again . 

3535. Probability: 0.9910
 Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . 

3536. Probability: 0.9844
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! 

3537. Probability: 0.9735
 Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . 

3538. Probability: 0.9761
 Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . 

3539. Probability: 0.9872
 Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . 

3540. Probability: 0.9886
 His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . 

3541. Probability: 0.9932
This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . 

3542. Probability: 0.9899
 No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! 

3543. Probability: 0.9985
 It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . 

3544. Probability: 0.9718
 I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . 

3545. Probability: 0.9713
 That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 

3546. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3547. Probability: 0.9816
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . 

3548. Probability: 0.9702
 How about a snack after work ? 

3549. Probability: 0.9988
 What a great idea ! 

3550. Probability: 0.9841
 I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . 

3551. Probability: 0.9970
 That is a good suggestion . 

3552. Probability: 0.9854
 You got a big return for a small gift . 

3553. Probability: 0.9825
You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! 

3554. Probability: 0.9883

 Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . 

3559. Probability: 0.9829
 Cheer up . You have got me at least . 

3560. Probability: 0.9711
Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ? 

3561. Probability: 0.9970
 I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! 

3562. Probability: 0.9919
 What about a factory tour ? 

3563. Probability: 0.9974
 Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 

3564. Probability: 0.9888
 I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 

3565. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3566. Probability: 0.9929
 How beautiful the detached house is ! 

3567. Probability: 0.9989
 It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . 

3568. Probability: 0.9778
 No wonder it smells fragrant . 

3569. Probability: 0.9967
 It's fantastic !

 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 

3571. Probability: 0.9899
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . 

3572. Probability: 0.9924
 Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly .

 I would look so cool carrying this around ! 

3574. Probability: 0.9827
 And you'd look so cool ! 

3575. Probability: 0.9919

 Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . 

3582. Probability: 0.9909
 What a good goal ! 

3583. Probability: 0.9903
 Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . 

3584. Probability: 0.9867
 I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . 

3585. Probability: 0.9855
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! 

3586. Probability: 0.9966
 Cool ! 

3587. Probability: 0.9853
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 

3588. Probability: 0.9957
 No way ! That sounds great ! 

3589. Probability: 0.9774
 Hey , I'll go with you . 

3590. Probability: 0.9866
 Wow ! ! And what does your brother do ? 

3591. Probability: 0.9919

3592. Probability: 0.9947
 What an interesting family ! 

3593. Probability: 0.9992
 Good idea . I like hanging out in bars at night .

 For killing time and making new friends . 

3595. Probability: 0.9700
 Well , I'll try . Then what would you like to drink ? It's on me .

 Oh , yes . I really like it here . 

3602. Probability: 0.9768
 Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ? 

3603. Probability: 0.9930
 OK . What about an evening riverboat tour ? 

3604. Probability: 0.9727
 Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater . 

3605. Probability: 0.9937
 Great ! Let's make a reservation . 

3606. Probability: 0.9773
I want to try something different today .

3608. Probability: 0.9967
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 

3609. Probability: 0.9769
 Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . 

3610. Probability: 0.9817
 What about water pollution instead of pollution ? 

3611. Probability: 0.9916
 Well done ! 

3612. Probability: 0.9950
 Wow ! 

3613. Probability: 0.9897
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . 

3614. Probability: 0.9738
 Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . 

3615. Probability: 0.9738
 The early bird catches the worm . 

3616. Probability: 0.9935
 That ’ s fabulous . Thank you . 

3617. Probability: 0.9967
 What a surprise ! This is the best present I've ever received . 

3618. Probability: 0.9890
 Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . 

3619. Probability: 0.9971
 That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? 

3620. Probability: 0.9857
 I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? 

3621. Probability: 0.9899
 It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . 

3622. Probability: 0.9808
 that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . 

3623. Probability: 0.9851
 No , seriously . I'm impressed .

 Really ? It looks so nice .

 How about some fish ? 

3633. Probability: 0.9741
 OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? 

3634. Probability: 0.9787
 It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . 

3635. Probability: 0.9731
 All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ? 

3636. Probability: 0.9803
 Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world . 

3637. Probability: 0.9863
 Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ? 

3638. Probability: 0.9895
 Perfect . I ’ ll pick you up then .

 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . 

3640. Probability: 0.9708

3641. Probability: 0.9711
 Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . 

3642. Probability: 0.9813
 Jay Chou's title song in his new album . 

3643. Probability: 0.9975
 Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile . 

3644. Probability: 0.9772
 Let me enjoy it . 

3645. Probability: 0.9872
 I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart . 

3646. Probability: 0.9718
 I cann't wait for buying his CD now . 

3647. Probability: 0.9965
 But it doesn't look like a real bus stop . 

3648. Probability: 0.9812
 Lucky her . 

3649. Probability: 0.9722
 Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger . 

3650. Probability: 0.9952
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 

3651. Probability: 0.9974
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! 

3652. Probability: 0.9950
 Yes , we do . It is an exciting moment . 

3653. Probability: 0.9722
 Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . 

3654. Probability: 0.9944
 Well , their team work is well worth learning . 

3655. Probability: 0.9705
 Yes . I found a very good job down here . 

3656. Probability: 0.9849
 Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ? 

3657. Probability: 0.9919
 That's great ! 

3658. Probability: 0.9926
 We should do this more often . 

3659. Probability: 0.9825
 So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind . 

3660. Probability: 0.9814
 Great , thanks a lot . 

3661. Probability: 0.9850
 Quite well , thank you . 

3662. Probability: 0.9922
 Sounds like a plan . Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00 . 

3663. Probability: 0.9781
 Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie ! 

3664. Probability: 0.9880
 Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ? 

3665. Probability: 0.9813
 I like to play the piano for fun . 

3666. Probability: 0.9914
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 

3667. Probability: 0.9829
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 

3668. Probability: 0.9988
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 

3669. Probability: 0.9823
 Come on , let ’ s try it . 

3670. Probability: 0.9921
 Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . 

3671. Probability: 0.9762
 Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . 

3672. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

3673. Probability: 0.9915
 That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . 

3674. Probability: 0.9920
Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! 

3675. Probability: 0.9854
 Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . 

3676. Probability: 0.9708
 Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! 

3677. Probability: 0.9976
 that's a good idea . 

3678. Probability: 0.9953
 I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . 

3679. Probability: 0.9758
 I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 

3680. Probability: 0.9709
 there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 

3681. Probability: 0.9772
 Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . 

3682. Probability: 0.9891
 And her voice like a lark's song ? 

3683. Probability: 0.9775
 Oh , she sings too ? 

3684. Probability: 0.9728
 Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . 

3685. Probability: 0.9971
 Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! 

3686. Probability: 0.9862
 I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . 

3687. Probability: 0.9797
 But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . 

3688. Probability: 0.9850
 How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? 

3689. Probability: 0.9904
 yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? 

3690. Probability: 0.9790
A beautiful center ! 

3691. Probability: 0.9823
 And good shot ! 

3692. Probability: 0.9880
 Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! 

3693. Probability: 0.9953
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 

3694. Probability: 0.9756
 It sure is . 

3695. Probability: 0.9961
 Yes , it looks interesting . 

3696. Probability: 0.9772
 You're right . I love it very much . 

3697. Probability: 0.9954
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 

3698. Probability: 0.9759
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 

3699. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3700. Probability: 0.9862
 Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . 

3701. Probability: 0.9975
 Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? 

3702. Probability: 0.9718
 That will be a good one ! Anything else ? 

3703. Probability: 0.9952
 Sounds great ! 

3704. Probability: 0.9946
 That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . 

3705. Probability: 0.9830
I decided to go for this kind of life . 

3706. Probability: 0.9896
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . 

3707. Probability: 0.9981
 Wow ! What a hit ! 

3708. Probability: 0.9864
 I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? 

3709. Probability: 0.9808
 Yes , come on , and we will have fun . 

3710. Probability: 0.9941
 Why , this is the most interesting film ! 

3711. Probability: 0.9729
 What ? Do you mean that you are pregnant ? Is it true ? 

3712. Probability: 0.9792
 Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? 

3713. Probability: 0.9954
 Wow , you're not kidding . Hold on a second . Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? 

3714. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

3715. Probability: 0.9937
But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet ! 

3716. Probability: 0.9952
 Sounds great ! 

3717. Probability: 0.9702
 Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room . 

3718. Probability: 0.9854
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . 

3719. Probability: 0.9761
 There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . 

3720. Probability: 0.9735
 That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? 

3721. Probability: 0.9911
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 

3722. Probability: 0.9840
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 

3723. Probability: 0.9969
 it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 

3724. Probability: 0.9748
 that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 

3725. Probability: 0.9842
 no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 

3726. Probability: 0.9922
 That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ? 

3727. Probability: 0.9773
 Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself . 

3728. Probability: 0.9944
 I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? 

3729. Probability: 0.9980
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . 

3730. Probability: 0.9714
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbours . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . 

3731. Probability: 0.9719
 I ’ m ready looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! 

3732. Probability: 0.9870
 Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . 

3733. Probability: 0.9909
 This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick . He shoots ! and he ... 

3734. Probability: 0.9925
 Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone . 

3735. Probability: 0.9732
 Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 

3736. Probability: 0.9782
 We're using worms . 

3737. Probability: 0.9711
 Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? 

3738. Probability: 0.9793
 But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? 

3739. Probability: 0.9845
 Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ? 

3740. Probability: 0.9765
 I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll . 

3741. Probability: 0.9853
We're lucky today . 

3742. Probability: 0.9732
 Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace 

3743. Probability: 0.9715
 Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there . 

3744. Probability: 0.9894
 Of course . Everything's so striking and fascinating . 

3745. Probability: 0.9815
 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 

3746. Probability: 0.9831
 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 

3747. Probability: 0.9928
 It ’ s pretty good . 

3748. Probability: 0.9979
 Good idea ! 

3749. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

3750. Probability: 0.9808
 Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . 

3751. Probability: 0.9871
 Three months ? Incredible ! 

3752. Probability: 0.9762
 A party ? Yes . I'd love to . Thank you for inviting me . Will Monica come ? 

3753. Probability: 0.9915
 That's great ! What time will it start at ? 

3754. Probability: 0.9971
 Oh , that sounds great ! 

3755. Probability: 0.9835
 Yes , that would be perfect . 

3756. Probability: 0.9713
 Well , I actually thumbed a lift . 

3757. Probability: 0.9924
 Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . 

3758. Probability: 0.9940
 Wow , good for you . 

3759. Probability: 0.9794
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 

3760. Probability: 0.9948
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 

3761. Probability: 0.9787
 April fool ! 

3762. Probability: 0.9938
I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! 

3763. Probability: 0.9812
 How about a china vase ? 

3764. Probability: 0.9979
 Good idea ! 

3765. Probability: 0.9777
 Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . 

3766. Probability: 0.9955
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? 

3767. Probability: 0.9793
 How about going to the theatre ? 

3768. Probability: 0.9713
 I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . 

3769. Probability: 0.9986
 That's a good idea . 

3770. Probability: 0.9976
 Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . 

3771. Probability: 0.9731
Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ? 

3772. Probability: 0.9729
 And I came up and asked to sit by you ... 

3773. Probability: 0.9927
 Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . 

3774. Probability: 0.9739
 The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . 

3775. Probability: 0.9700
 You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith . 

3776. Probability: 0.9828
Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome . 

3777. Probability: 0.9932
 Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball . 

3778. Probability: 0.9798
 Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect . 

3779. Probability: 0.9933
 I have an idea . 

3780. Probability: 0.9747
 I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ? 

3781. Probability: 0.9707
 Yes , I can . 

3782. Probability: 0.9798
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 

3783. Probability: 0.9863
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 

3784. Probability: 0.9902
 Www ! 

3785. Probability: 0.9981
 Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 

3786. Probability: 0.9812
When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? 

3787. Probability: 0.9792
 Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then . 

3788. Probability: 0.9702
 Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started . 

3789. Probability: 0.9719
 Good . See you later . 

3790. Probability: 0.9773
 No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? 

3791. Probability: 0.9841
 Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . 

3792. Probability: 0.9757
 Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 

3793. Probability: 0.9863
 yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . 

3794. Probability: 0.9952
 cool . 

3795. Probability: 0.9738
 He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 

3796. Probability: 0.9951
 You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . 

3797. Probability: 0.9779
 That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? 

3798. Probability: 0.9890
 It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . 

3799. Probability: 0.9871
 I appreciate it . It is related to company image . 

3800. Probability: 0.9778
 It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . 

3801. Probability: 0.9846
 Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead ! 

3802. Probability: 0.9735
 Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . 

3803. Probability: 0.9992
 Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? 

3804. Probability: 0.9842
Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . 

3805. Probability: 0.9860
 Now . you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . 

3806. Probability: 0.9840
 Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? 

3807. Probability: 0.9945
 It's interesting and I want to buy one home . 

3808. Probability: 0.9934
 Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? 

3809. Probability: 0.9871
 Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? 

3810. Probability: 0.9909
I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . 

3811. Probability: 0.9870
 A magic love potion ? 

3812. Probability: 0.9723
 That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? 

3813. Probability: 0.9778
 Stand on the chair , Pig Tom . Use your brain . 

3814. Probability: 0.9887
 How about the podium ? 

3815. Probability: 0.9803
 Yes , it's perfect ! 

3816. Probability: 0.9831
 He's diving for the gold . 

3817. Probability: 0.9853
 That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? 

3818. Probability: 0.9964
 Yeah , it was a lot of fun . 

3819. Probability: 0.9921
 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . 

3820. Probability: 0.9878
 Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . 

3821. Probability: 0.9958
 I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears . 

3822. Probability: 0.9803
 It has got this year's Oscar Award . 

3823. Probability: 0.9940
 It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration . 

3824. Probability: 0.9924
 Really ? That's nice . 

3825. Probability: 0.9883
 I liked it . I thought it was great . 

3826. Probability: 0.9747
 Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? 

3827. Probability: 0.9880
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? 

3828. Probability: 0.9797
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? 

3829. Probability: 0.9900
 Looks like a lucky day for everyone . 

3830. Probability: 0.9813
 Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . 

3831. Probability: 0.9703
 Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages . 

3832. Probability: 0.9886
 That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks . 

3833. Probability: 0.9972
 Wow . That's wonderful . 

3834. Probability: 0.9724
 Oh , I'm shocked . 

3835. Probability: 0.9719
 Good . See you later . 

3836. Probability: 0.9988
 Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . 

3837. Probability: 0.9894
 Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . 

3838. Probability: 0.9805
 Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! 

3839. Probability: 0.9886

3840. Probability: 0.9879
 Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . 

3841. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

3842. Probability: 0.9818
 Congratulations ! I knew you could do it . 

3843. Probability: 0.9730
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 

3844. Probability: 0.9773
 OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? 

3845. Probability: 0.9796
 Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? 

3846. Probability: 0.9936
 Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? 

3847. Probability: 0.9964
 Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? 

3848. Probability: 0.9898
 How about Legally Blonde . 

3849. Probability: 0.9873
 Very good . 

3850. Probability: 0.9865
 It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well ! 

3851. Probability: 0.9862
David , imagine meeting you here ! 

3852. Probability: 0.9757
 All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers . 

3853. Probability: 0.9961
 So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . 

3854. Probability: 0.9818
 Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . 

3855. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3856. Probability: 0.9856
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 

3857. Probability: 0.9934
 Great . 

3858. Probability: 0.9751
 To the cinema . What about coming with me ? 

3859. Probability: 0.9963
 Oh , does she ? That's convenient . 

3860. Probability: 0.9863
 You did ? that is great ! 

3861. Probability: 0.9779
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 

3862. Probability: 0.9713
 Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . 

3863. Probability: 0.9978
 He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance . 

3864. Probability: 0.9911
 I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... 

3865. Probability: 0.9974
 That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? 

3866. Probability: 0.9871
 The night life there . It's so romantic ! 

3867. Probability: 0.9715
 Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? 

3868. Probability: 0.9950
 Sounds exciting . I can't wait . 

3869. Probability: 0.9866
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? 

3870. Probability: 0.9798
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 

3871. Probability: 0.9857
 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 

3872. Probability: 0.9827
 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 

3873. Probability: 0.9950
 It is incredible . 

3874. Probability: 0.9727
 That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 

3875. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3876. Probability: 0.9786
 Yeah . Falling in love is so good ! 

3877. Probability: 0.9913
 Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it . 

3878. Probability: 0.9758
 Let's stop and have a look . 

3879. Probability: 0.9959
 This dish is really delicious . 

3880. Probability: 0.9866
 I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it . 

3881. Probability: 0.9923
 You ’ re great . Could you say it in Chinese ? 

3882. Probability: 0.9848
 Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . 

3883. Probability: 0.9981
 That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . 

3884. Probability: 0.9777
 If China didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? 

3885. Probability: 0.9918
 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 

3886. Probability: 0.9984
 It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! 

3887. Probability: 0.9911
Good game ? 

3888. Probability: 0.9922
 Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? 

3889. Probability: 0.9910
 No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . 

3890. Probability: 0.9963
 Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . 

3891. Probability: 0.9929
 Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? 

3892. Probability: 0.9762
 Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you . 

3893. Probability: 0.9886
 It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 

3894. Probability: 0.9892
 How about rumba ? 

3895. Probability: 0.9771
 Really ? You must like tango , right ? 

3896. Probability: 0.9907
 Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well . 

3897. Probability: 0.9874
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now . 

3898. Probability: 0.9748
 OK . I'll have a try . 

3899. Probability: 0.9963
 Oh , you dance it so well . 

3900. Probability: 0.9814
 I think I'm your lucky fellow . 

3901. Probability: 0.9918
Ashley , what a great dinner party ! 

3902. Probability: 0.9990
 Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ? 

3903. Probability: 0.9979
 Yes , the chicken looks wonderful ! 

3904. Probability: 0.9883
 How about some salad to go with your chicken ? 

3905. Probability: 0.9824
 Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken ! 

3906. Probability: 0.9827
 Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set . 

3907. Probability: 0.9774
 Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 

3908. Probability: 0.9838
My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! 

3909. Probability: 0.9976
 So cool ! Can I get a load of it ? 

3910. Probability: 0.9762
I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? 

3911. Probability: 0.9941
 Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? 

3912. Probability: 0.9806
 It's white gold . 

3913. Probability: 0.9928
 Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . 

3914. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

3915. Probability: 0.9797
 I like Renaldo the most . 

3916. Probability: 0.9716
 If you are free , maybe you can get having for my birthday party , it should be fun . 

3917. Probability: 0.9835
 Sounds great , i ' d very much like having something thanks , when ? 

3918. Probability: 0.9913
 Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating . 

3919. Probability: 0.9827
 Great . I have a good day , thanks again for the offer . 

3920. Probability: 0.9718
Look ! It's clearing up . 

3921. Probability: 0.9740

 Yes , great ! 

3923. Probability: 0.9936
 Oh , that's great . You're serious this time . 

3924. Probability: 0.9897
You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! 

3925. Probability: 0.9838
 How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . 

3926. Probability: 0.9942
 That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? 

3927. Probability: 0.9774
 Oh , buddy , you are so kind . Thank you ! 

3928. Probability: 0.9701
 Oh , I'm going for a trip to New York this autumn . What's the weather like in New York ? 

3929. Probability: 0.9817
 We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display . 

3930. Probability: 0.9774
 If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . 

3931. Probability: 0.9991
 Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . 

3932. Probability: 0.9990
 Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . 

3933. Probability: 0.9802
 I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . 

3934. Probability: 0.9988
 That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . 

3935. Probability: 0.9771
 I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . 

3936. Probability: 0.9868
 A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . 

3937. Probability: 0.9865
 I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . 

3938. Probability: 0.9851
 No , seriously . I'm impressed . 

3939. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3940. Probability: 0.9892
 That sounds great . Thanks . 

3941. Probability: 0.9746
 I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . 

3942. Probability: 0.9992
 Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . 

3943. Probability: 0.9951
 It sure looks special , looks expensive too . 

3944. Probability: 0.9754
 Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ? 

3945. Probability: 0.9786
 But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 

3946. Probability: 0.9776
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 

3947. Probability: 0.9741
 Toss a coin to decide then . 

3948. Probability: 0.9862
 Well , why not use buses or the MET ? 

3949. Probability: 0.9760
 Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? 

3950. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3951. Probability: 0.9978
 Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . 

3952. Probability: 0.9883
 Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? 

3953. Probability: 0.9769
 Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . 

3954. Probability: 0.9945
 Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? 

3955. Probability: 0.9915
 Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled . 

3956. Probability: 0.9977
 That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? 

3957. Probability: 0.9961
 That sounds like fun . 

3958. Probability: 0.9936
Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . 

3959. Probability: 0.9986
 Great idea ! I do it every so often . 

3960. Probability: 0.9776
 So tricky ! 

3961. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

3962. Probability: 0.9751
 Oh . What about Saturday ? Are you free then ? 

3963. Probability: 0.9814
 Yes ! Yes ! I want to take you to dinner . 

3964. Probability: 0.9927
 Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ? 

3965. Probability: 0.9721
 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 

3966. Probability: 0.9769
 Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 

3967. Probability: 0.9886
 Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . 

3968. Probability: 0.9989
 What a great idea . 

3969. Probability: 0.9862
 Cute , like you . 

3970. Probability: 0.9737
 Thx . 

3971. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

3972. Probability: 0.9730
 Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' . 

3973. Probability: 0.9892
 It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . 

3974. Probability: 0.9961
 That sounds like fun . 

3975. Probability: 0.9791
 That's nice . Where have you been ? 

3976. Probability: 0.9814
 How about a coffee in that cafe ? 

3977. Probability: 0.9860
 Great . Let's talk over coffee . 

3978. Probability: 0.9764
 Maybe that's why he's so nice ! 

3979. Probability: 0.9751
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! 

3980. Probability: 0.9778
 Me ! Me ! 

3981. Probability: 0.9906
 Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! 

3982. Probability: 0.9862
 That would be great ! Give me a call ! 

3983. Probability: 0.9964
 Good ideas . 

3984. Probability: 0.9712
 Yes . Have a look . 

3985. Probability: 0.9881
 Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim . 

3986. Probability: 0.9932
 Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . 

3987. Probability: 0.9777
 I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? 

3988. Probability: 0.9774
 Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . 

3989. Probability: 0.9801
 Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 

3990. Probability: 0.9838
 ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... 

3991. Probability: 0.9739
 The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! 

3992. Probability: 0.9824
 When pigs fly ! 

3993. Probability: 0.9928
 You are flattering me . 

3994. Probability: 0.9799
 Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune . 

3995. Probability: 0.9714
 Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ? 

3996. Probability: 0.9747
 We'll have to negotiate that . It's a possibility . 

3997. Probability: 0.9863
 I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? 

3998. Probability: 0.9780
 I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! 

3999. Probability: 0.9892
 Good for you ! 

4000. Probability: 0.9792
 Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . 

4001. Probability: 0.9743
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 

4002. Probability: 0.9751
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 

4003. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

4004. Probability: 0.9783
 Yes . I like it very much . 

4005. Probability: 0.9931
 Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . 

4006. Probability: 0.9942
 It's excellent . 

4007. Probability: 0.9817
 Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . 

4008. Probability: 0.9781
 It's delicious . 

4009. Probability: 0.9927
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . 

4010. Probability: 0.9856
 That's great . Thank you so much . 

4011. Probability: 0.9810
 A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you . 

4012. Probability: 0.9866
 Thank you , they are beautiful . 

4013. Probability: 0.9905
 that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . 

4014. Probability: 0.9702
 Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? 

4015. Probability: 0.9925
 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on .

What a brilliant smile ! 

4021. Probability: 0.9798
Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . 

4022. Probability: 0.9743
 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 

4023. Probability: 0.9970
 Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all . 

4024. Probability: 0.9899
 That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 

4025. Probability: 0.9861
 Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to .

 It's a surprise ! 

4028. Probability: 0.9892
 Great . My family came to visit me . 

4029. Probability: 0.9922
 Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? 

4030. Probability: 0.9826
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? 

4031. Probability: 0.9793
 How about going to a concert ? 

4032. Probability: 0.9833
 That suits me fine . 

4033. Probability: 0.9715
 I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? 

4034. Probability: 0.9848
 Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . 

4035. Probability: 0.9767
 Yes , honey ... 

4036. Probability: 0.9781
 Just for fun , not for showing . What do you worry about ? 

4037. Probability: 0.9835
 Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . 

4038. Probability: 0.9862
 You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 

4039. Probability: 0.9795
I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . 

4040. Probability: 0.9976
 What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? 

4041. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

4042. Probability: 0.9915
 People think it's funny . 

4043. Probability: 0.9928
 That must be very beautiful . 

4044. Probability: 0.9977
 Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . 

4045. Probability: 0.9750
 Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . 

4046. Probability: 0.9838
 Yeah , it'll make a hit , I think.When will it be on , do you know ? 

4047. Probability: 0.9774
 Give me a screwdriver on the rocks . 

4048. Probability: 0.9788
 Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person .

 I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? 

4259. Probability: 0.9829
 We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . 

4260. Probability: 0.9975
 Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? 

4261. Probability: 0.9872
 How about the iguana ? 

4262. Probability: 0.9959
 I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . 

4263. Probability: 0.9864
 Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? 

4264. Probability: 0.9990
 my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b 

4265. Probability: 0.9993
 that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 

4266. Probability: 0.9870
 most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help 

4267. Probability: 0.9737
 How about the mileage ? 

4268. Probability: 0.9703
 Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable . They are very good in colour , flavour , and taste . 

4269. Probability: 0.9924
 No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . 

4270. Probability: 0.9920
 Yes , really . 

4271. Probability: 0.9767
 so how about an aperitif ? 

4272. Probability: 0.9730
 it sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . 

4273. Probability: 0.9762
 try a Singer . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice . 

4274. Probability: 0.9948
 it sounds interesting . I'll take one . 

4275. Probability: 0.9754
This suit looks nice.Can I try it on ? 

4276. Probability: 0.9849
 it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . 

4277. Probability: 0.9946
 They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . 

4278. Probability: 0.9837
I like this shirt.How much is it ? 

4279. Probability: 0.9832
 I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . 

4280. Probability: 0.9710
 First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . 

4281. Probability: 0.9805
Do you really like this straw hat , dear ? 

4282. Probability: 0.9725
 Yes , of course . I'll take it . 

4283. Probability: 0.9847
 I like it . 

4284. Probability: 0.9801
 The works ? 

4285. Probability: 0.9902
 OK . How about some fried spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 

4286. Probability: 0.9702
 Well ... the beer sounds good ! 

4287. Probability: 0.9864
 I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . 

4288. Probability: 0.9701
Welcome to our shop . It seems you are interested in this dress . 

4289. Probability: 0.9810
 French toast sounds good . What are you going to order ? 

4290. Probability: 0.9790
 A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . 

4291. Probability: 0.9996
 Here ’ s an interesting ad 

4292. Probability: 0.9901
 Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . 

4293. Probability: 0.9757
It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . 

4294. Probability: 0.9851
 Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . 

4295. Probability: 0.9843
 Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . 

4296. Probability: 0.9867
 Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . 

4297. Probability: 0.9747
 OK . How about after the shower ? 

4298. Probability: 0.9811
 After the shower , step into the washroom with birch switches , dip them in the warm water and briskly whisk them over your skin . 

4299. Probability: 0.9803
 Yes , then enter the bathroom , There is a stove tired with wood in the room , and on the top of the stove , there is a pile of stones , which keep the heat . Throw some water on the stones , and dry steam is given off . 

4300. Probability: 0.9833
 Can I have a look at your handworks ? 

4301. Probability: 0.9820
 You have quite a range , haven't you ? 

4302. Probability: 0.9751
 Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese . 

4303. Probability: 0.9955
 How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful . 

4304. Probability: 0.9925
 Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? 

4305. Probability: 0.9813
It looks delicious . I will order it . 

4306. Probability: 0.9977
 Well , that's cool . 

4307. Probability: 0.9722
 I'll make sure and come to your next party . 

4308. Probability: 0.9756
 You really do a good job . 

4309. Probability: 0.9827
 Wow , I can't thank you enough . 

4310. Probability: 0.9807
 Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? 

4311. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

4312. Probability: 0.9815
 Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in . 

4313. Probability: 0.9923
 Oh , this one is perfect . 

4314. Probability: 0.9914
 That's great . 

4315. Probability: 0.9957
What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . 

4316. Probability: 0.9774
 Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . 

4317. Probability: 0.9850
 Oh , good ! You know , I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs , not fried . 

4318. Probability: 0.9796
 Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens . 

4319. Probability: 0.9946
 Yes , it ’ s brand-new . 

4320. Probability: 0.9926
 It sounds great . How much is the rent ? 

4321. Probability: 0.9777
 Ok , that would be great . 

4322. Probability: 0.9942
 That's great ... 

4323. Probability: 0.9788
 Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! 

4324. Probability: 0.9780
 Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back . 

4325. Probability: 0.9939
 That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne . Will that be acceptable ? 

4326. Probability: 0.9879
 Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ? 

4327. Probability: 0.9744
 Sounds good . Thanks for your help . 

4328. Probability: 0.9931
 That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . 

4329. Probability: 0.9822
 Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum . 

4330. Probability: 0.9970
 Oh , yes ! This is much better . But it has an aluminum handle . 

4331. Probability: 0.9926
 Yes . That's perfect . I'll take it . 

4332. Probability: 0.9756
 Great . Will that be cash or charge ? 

4333. Probability: 0.9827
 Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? 

4334. Probability: 0.9828
 That's good . What's the fee ? 

4335. Probability: 0.9959
 Good idea . Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan . Besides that , what's your secret ? 

4336. Probability: 0.9714
 Sure . Brown and we have reserved a table next to the door . 

4337. Probability: 0.9767
 That sounds OK . I'll need it from the 10th to the 14th . 

4338. Probability: 0.9978
 Wow , how exciting . 

4339. Probability: 0.9857
 I appreciate that . 

4340. Probability: 0.9810
 I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . 

4341. Probability: 0.9834
 This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . 

4342. Probability: 0.9876
 But it is really worthwhile . 

4343. Probability: 0.9883
 Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . 

4344. Probability: 0.9916
 Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . 

4345. Probability: 0.9942
 How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . 

4346. Probability: 0.9861
 Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . 

4347. Probability: 0.9821
 Take a look at this dress ! Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? 

4348. Probability: 0.9819
 That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? 

4349. Probability: 0.9857
 You're a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hotpot . 

4350. Probability: 0.9831
 Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 

4351. Probability: 0.9756
 That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! 

4352. Probability: 0.9903
 You really have a bid head , don't you ! 

4353. Probability: 0.9798
Look , who's here , Peter ! 

4354. Probability: 0.9849
 Women ’ s dresses . They are fashionable and suit Australian women well , too . If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable , we ’ ll purchase large quantities of them . Will you please quote us a price ? 

4355. Probability: 0.9769
 What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ? 

4356. Probability: 0.9799
 Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? 

4357. Probability: 0.9819
 Well , it's a wedding gift . 

4358. Probability: 0.9863
 Oh , I see . Let me guess ... something sexy for the new bride on her first night of marriage ? 

4359. Probability: 0.9929
 I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . 

4360. Probability: 0.9860
 That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful . 

4361. Probability: 0.9791
 Yeah ! 

4362. Probability: 0.9821
 I can do that . And I would like to make dumplings later . 

4363. Probability: 0.9871
 A Sprite sounds good . 

4364. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

4365. Probability: 0.9886
 Oh , that's very kind of you . Thank you very much . I've got to go . 

4366. Probability: 0.9829
 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 

4367. Probability: 0.9912
 Hey , look . My admirer has struck again . 

4368. Probability: 0.9915
 It's an e-mail . It says , We need to meet . I'll give you a sweet treat . It's not what you think . 

4369. Probability: 0.9957
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . 

4370. Probability: 0.9819
 I ’ m so excited . 

4371. Probability: 0.9837
 That would be wonderful . 

4372. Probability: 0.9858
 You have to do something romantic . 

4373. Probability: 0.9834
 Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . 

4374. Probability: 0.9982
 It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? 

4375. Probability: 0.9758
 They're much better 

4376. Probability: 0.9708
 That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . 

4377. Probability: 0.9725
 Good . Listen . I'm phoning because I want to invite you to a party . At our Newhouse . And . . 

4378. Probability: 0.9741
 Yes . We've moved . That's why we're giving the party . Can you come ? 

4379. Probability: 0.9977
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 

4380. Probability: 0.9857
 I appreciate that . 

4381. Probability: 0.9978
 It's very good , and the result isn't too bad . 

4382. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

4383. Probability: 0.9829
 That's great . Thank you very much . 

4384. Probability: 0.9938
 Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there ! 

4385. Probability: 0.9950
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! 

4386. Probability: 0.9981
 Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . 

4387. Probability: 0.9849
 Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' 

4388. Probability: 0.9982
 Let's take a roundabout way . 

4389. Probability: 0.9833
 Those patio tables are new , aren't they ? Would it be possible to be seated out there ? 

4390. Probability: 0.9788
 Yes , could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order ? 

4391. Probability: 0.9981
 No , it ’ s pretty good . Why not give the landlord a call ? 

4392. Probability: 0.9756
 Sure . Let me show you the way . Here we are . Apartment 1008 . ( They enter . ) This is the living room dining room combination . Here's the kitchen . It's small , but fully equipped . The refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old . 

4393. Probability: 0.9786
 It's nice . So this is the bathroom . And that must be the bedroom . 

4394. Probability: 0.9799
 Yes . And there's a walk-in closet . 

4395. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

4396. Probability: 0.9717
 I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try . 

4397. Probability: 0.9867
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 

4398. Probability: 0.9870
 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 

4399. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

4400. Probability: 0.9847
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . 

4401. Probability: 0.9844
 Good . Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best ? 

4402. Probability: 0.9873
 This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great . 

4403. Probability: 0.9986
 Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . 

4404. Probability: 0.9889
 Try it and see if it works . 

4405. Probability: 0.9982
 I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea . 

4406. Probability: 0.9774
 I'm awesome . 

4407. Probability: 0.9967
 That's good thinking . 

4408. Probability: 0.9716
 The apples in my room were delicious . Bring me a few more , please . 

4409. Probability: 0.9922
 The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good . 

4410. Probability: 0.9723
 Apple pie , please . 

4411. Probability: 0.9830
 Make it two . 

4412. Probability: 0.9781
 That's very kind of you . 

4413. Probability: 0.9739
 All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . 

4414. Probability: 0.9793
 why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! 

4415. Probability: 0.9767
 I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . 

4416. Probability: 0.9827
 I am quite outgoing , I think . 

4417. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

4418. Probability: 0.9756
 I think it ’ s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ? 

4419. Probability: 0.9936
 Very well . We have some fresh red roses . 

4420. Probability: 0.9904
 That sounds like a good deal . 

4421. Probability: 0.9876
 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? 

4422. Probability: 0.9814
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 

4423. Probability: 0.9774
 You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . 

4424. Probability: 0.9716
 Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you . 

4425. Probability: 0.9813
I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! 

4426. Probability: 0.9784
 Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! 

4427. Probability: 0.9909
 Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . 

4428. Probability: 0.9773
 Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . 

4429. Probability: 0.9721
 Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? 

4430. Probability: 0.9839
 I'm a great cook actually . You will see . 

4431. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

4432. Probability: 0.9922
 Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . 

4433. Probability: 0.9938
 That's a good idea . All right , I ’ ll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind . 

4434. Probability: 0.9850
 That's great ! How much is it ? 

4435. Probability: 0.9855
 Yes , that's the ticket ! And if I need to print something there ? 

4436. Probability: 0.9715
 Anything is worth a try . But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap . 

4437. Probability: 0.9846
 I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . 

4438. Probability: 0.9705
 I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue . 

4439. Probability: 0.9888
 But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park . 

4440. Probability: 0.9759
 Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something ? 

4441. Probability: 0.9712
 I'm going to do that . 

4442. Probability: 0.9834
 All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . 

4443. Probability: 0.9943
 I can skillfully use Dos , Windows . 

4444. Probability: 0.9778
 Me ! Me ! 

4445. Probability: 0.9975
 Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? 

4446. Probability: 0.9714
 Sure . The fitting room is in the corner . 

4447. Probability: 0.9927
 The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . 

4448. Probability: 0.9969
 Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . 

4449. Probability: 0.9855
 OK . Bingo ! We win . Give me five , Mom . 

4450. Probability: 0.9906
 Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ? 

4451. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . 

4452. Probability: 0.9810
 Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? 

4453. Probability: 0.9872
 That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . 

4454. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

4455. Probability: 0.9842
Hey , Philip ! You won ’ t believe this ! 

4456. Probability: 0.9932
 That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him !

 Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . 

4460. Probability: 0.9992
 Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?

4462. Probability: 0.9948
 This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! 

4463. Probability: 0.9753
 Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . 

4464. Probability: 0.9993
 This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! 

4465. Probability: 0.9971
 Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! 

4466. Probability: 0.9988

4473. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

4474. Probability: 0.9882
 Pretty good , I'd say . 

4475. Probability: 0.9700
 That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . 

4476. Probability: 0.9888
 Wow ! A third more ? Very good . 

4477. Probability: 0.9941

 Sure . Can we use it in Today Supermarket ? 

4487. Probability: 0.9749
 That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . 

4488. Probability: 0.9851
 Let's give it a shot ! 

4489. Probability: 0.9725
 So it has attracted more and more customers these days . 

4490. Probability: 0.9723

4491. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

4492. Probability: 0.9925

4502. Probability: 0.9979
 Good idea , let's shop to we drop ! 

4503. Probability: 0.9892
 Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . Set the wave a little looser than usual , please .

4508. Probability: 0.9988
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .

 Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? 

4524. Probability: 0.9809
 I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . 

4525. Probability: 0.9767
 Well , do you want burgers , Chinese food , or Mexican food ? 

4526. Probability: 0.9849

4558. Probability: 0.9755
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . 

4559. Probability: 0.9708
 Good . How much is a one-way ticket ? 

4560. Probability: 0.9777

 Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? 

4567. Probability: 0.9953
Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ?

 That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? 

4589. Probability: 0.9934
 It does sound appealing . 

4590. Probability: 0.9994

4609. Probability: 0.9972
 Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun . 

4610. Probability: 0.9745
 Well , I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change . 

4611. Probability: 0.9826
Hey , Mom , look what I found ! 

4612. Probability: 0.9764

4635. Probability: 0.9851

4636. Probability: 0.9831
 Maybe we can try ' Yuanyang pot ' this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . 

4637. Probability: 0.9905
 Sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well .

 Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ? 

4641. Probability: 0.9745

4660. Probability: 0.9835
 That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information . 

4661. Probability: 0.9993
 That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? 

4662. Probability: 0.9863
 Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . 

4663. Probability: 0.9743
 You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? 

4664. Probability: 0.9815
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . 

4665. Probability: 0.9715
 That's good . Thank you .

 It's good . It's a nice room .

 You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours . 

4785. Probability: 0.9705
 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . 

4786. Probability: 0.9975
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot .

 Really ! I've never seen so much work .

4879. Probability: 0.9765
 Kebabs and roast squid .

 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 

4889. Probability: 0.9919
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . 

4890. Probability: 0.9827

 Thank you . Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting ? 

5027. Probability: 0.9891
 Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . 

5028. Probability: 0.9709
 No . And on the contrary , I feel young , fresh and energetic .

5048. Probability: 0.9820
I feel like to wear my hair in this way . 

5049. Probability: 0.9708
 Okay then . And I also want to have my hair colored .

5097. Probability: 0.9799
With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? 

5098. Probability: 0.9785
 Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to New York for 18th next month . 

5099. Probability: 0.9800
 Great . I'll wait right here , thanks . 

5100. Probability: 0.9990
 ... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz . 

5101. Probability: 0.9831
 That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation . 

5102. Probability: 0.9968
 I have a better idea . Let's go to a jazz concert and I'll give you an education in jazz . 

5103. Probability: 0.9788
 Good . Now the other eye . 

5104. Probability: 0.9883
 Oh , good .

 That sounds all right to us . 

5111. Probability: 0.9891
 Squid balls ? How about some more fruit ! 

5112. Probability: 0.9848
 Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates ! 

5113. Probability: 0.9979
 Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ... 

5114. Probability: 0.9730
 Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . 

5115. Probability: 0.9939
 Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . 

5116. Probability: 0.9723
 And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... 

5117. Probability: 0.9706
 Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? 

5118. Probability: 0.9940

5119. Probability: 0.9969
 Interesting ... 

5120. Probability: 0.9975
 That's really special . 

5121. Probability: 0.9742
 Yes . in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you ? 

5122. Probability: 0.9907
 We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . 

5123. Probability: 0.9779
 You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . 

5124. Probability: 0.9859
 I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . 

5125. Probability: 0.9810
 Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ? 

5126. Probability: 0.9746
 So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! 

5127. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ?

 Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .

5148. Probability: 0.9917
 A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . 

5149. Probability: 0.9989
 Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures . 

5150. Probability: 0.9784
 Maybe we should try a thai massage too . 

5151. Probability: 0.9921
 That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . 

5152. Probability: 0.9814

 That's wonderful . I will see the Old Faithful for myself . 

5208. Probability: 0.9799

 OK . I'll try . But I'm not sure Federal Express picks up mail in this city . If that's the case , I'll send the package through Chinese express mail service . 

5518. Probability: 0.9887
 OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 

5519. Probability: 0.9702
 Well ... the beer sounds good ! 

5520. Probability: 0.9788
 Oh , yes . That is a beautiful color . It has been a very popular lipstick this season . I have just two left . 

5521. Probability: 0.9944
 Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ? 

5522. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

5523. Probability: 0.9941
 That's wonderful . I want to stay for 2 days . 

5524. Probability: 0.9832
 really well , thanks . 

5525. Probability: 0.9768
 yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . 

5526. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5527. Probability: 0.9940
 But I make it . 

5528. Probability: 0.9843
 Great – That ’ ll be big help , Ms . Green . 

5529. Probability: 0.9977
 Yes , of course . How about this one ? It's a new route . 

5530. Probability: 0.9969
 That's wonderful . By the way , what kind of cabin will I have ? 

5531. Probability: 0.9908
 Oh . that's very nice of him . 

5532. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5533. Probability: 0.9907
 Sounds good to me . 

5534. Probability: 0.9888
 I like it very much . 

5535. Probability: 0.9881
 A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . 

5536. Probability: 0.9930
What a wonderful sight ! 

5537. Probability: 0.9853
 It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains . 

5538. Probability: 0.9785
 Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads . 

5539. Probability: 0.9984
 That's a good idea ! 

5540. Probability: 0.9856
 True , and I like the kitchen . It's new and well equipped . 

5541. Probability: 0.9780
 It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . 

5542. Probability: 0.9778
 Good . I'll take it right now , if possible . 

5543. Probability: 0.9704
 Yes . I'll have a room free next week . 

5544. Probability: 0.9942
 How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . 

5545. Probability: 0.9861
 Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . 

5546. Probability: 0.9806
 Take a look at this dress . Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? 

5547. Probability: 0.9815
 Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? 

5548. Probability: 0.9785
 Maybe I'll try that store out . 

5549. Probability: 0.9922
 You're making me a believer . 

5550. Probability: 0.9757
 I'm splendid . How about yourself ? 

5551. Probability: 0.9872
 Smart . 

5552. Probability: 0.9853
 Yes , you're lucky . But you should go to the Ultrasonic Department to disperse the stone . Meanwhile , I'll give you some herbal medicine . 

5553. Probability: 0.9763
 How about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? 

5554. Probability: 0.9747
 The name ’ s Stanley Morris and the order was for two chef ’ s salads . 

5555. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5556. Probability: 0.9720
 Thanks , Vivian . 

5557. Probability: 0.9969
Cute ... Here . These beans are already ground . Now for step three 

5558. Probability: 0.9869
 That sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . 

5559. Probability: 0.9821
 Look ! This window is open . 

5560. Probability: 0.9737
 It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . 

5561. Probability: 0.9851
 Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding . 

5562. Probability: 0.9977
 Maybe . But it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . I'm getting to like the game more and more . 

5563. Probability: 0.9750
 I have never tasted that . I would like to have a try today . 

5564. Probability: 0.9895
 Fantastic ! I got the promotion ! 

5565. Probability: 0.9700
 Great ! When do you take over ? 

5566. Probability: 0.9730
 How about the microphone and speakers ? 

5567. Probability: 0.9848
 That sounds not bad at all . I'll take it . 

5568. Probability: 0.9858
 Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . 

5569. Probability: 0.9724
 That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . 

5570. Probability: 0.9733
 OK . I'll go and get a pair of them . 

5571. Probability: 0.9833
 sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! 

5572. Probability: 0.9927
 you always have unique ideas and you're such a team leader . 

5573. Probability: 0.9802
 Yes , so this year we are going to take our first family vacation , just you and I . 

5574. Probability: 0.9901
 You did a fabulous job . 

5575. Probability: 0.9741
 Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . 

5576. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5577. Probability: 0.9786
 She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills . 

5578. Probability: 0.9914
 That's great . 

5579. Probability: 0.9732
 Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? 

5580. Probability: 0.9981
 Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . 

5581. Probability: 0.9883
 Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it . 

5582. Probability: 0.9956
 Well , sounds very attractive . I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious . 

5583. Probability: 0.9814
 Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it . 

5584. Probability: 0.9878
 I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . 

5585. Probability: 0.9899
 yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . 

5586. Probability: 0.9962
 that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . 

5587. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5588. Probability: 0.9986
 That's great . I'd like to book four single rooms , five double rooms and three suites . 

5589. Probability: 0.9904
 That's wonderful . Thank you . 

5590. Probability: 0.9889
 Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? 

5591. Probability: 0.9826
 Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . 

5592. Probability: 0.9974
 Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? 

5593. Probability: 0.9840
 We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . 

5594. Probability: 0.9898
 Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... 

5595. Probability: 0.9821
 Perhaps you could give her a ring ? 

5596. Probability: 0.9826
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! 

5597. Probability: 0.9982
 Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . 

5598. Probability: 0.9806
 That works for me . 

5599. Probability: 0.9710
 So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . 

5600. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

5601. Probability: 0.9977
 Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? 

5602. Probability: 0.9963
 Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! 

5603. Probability: 0.9943
 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . 

5604. Probability: 0.9805
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 

5605. Probability: 0.9710
 Sure . I think filet steak will be a good choice . It's the best local food . 

5606. Probability: 0.9857
 I appreciate that . 

5607. Probability: 0.9798
OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! 

5608. Probability: 0.9917
 Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! 

5609. Probability: 0.9719
 Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year . 

5610. Probability: 0.9787
 What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? 

5611. Probability: 0.9814
 What if I repay it early . Any perks ? 

5612. Probability: 0.9808
 Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? 

5613. Probability: 0.9969
 Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . 

5614. Probability: 0.9931
 Well , your making cinnamon toast inspired me to go out and buy a waffle maker . 

5615. Probability: 0.9874
 Well , that was fun . Let's do it again soon . 

5616. Probability: 0.9926
 OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . 

5617. Probability: 0.9914
 Oh , OK . Wow ! 

5618. Probability: 0.9973
 Wow . That sounds really good . 

5619. Probability: 0.9705
 Mm , it is . 

5620. Probability: 0.9969
 Perfect ! I like this one . 

5621. Probability: 0.9948
 That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ? 

5622. Probability: 0.9711
 Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ? 

5623. Probability: 0.9901
 Great ! Let ’ s do it ! 

5624. Probability: 0.9787
 That's good . I'll tell them later . And what kind of medicine we should be prepared ? 

5625. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5626. Probability: 0.9734
 Great , I'm glad we'll be able to do business together . I'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning . 

5627. Probability: 0.9883
 I'll do with the cake . 

5628. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5629. Probability: 0.9969
 That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . 

5630. Probability: 0.9715
 I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' 

5631. Probability: 0.9923
 That's terrific . Thank you . 

5632. Probability: 0.9911
 Sure . Come to look at these styles . They sell very well . 

5633. Probability: 0.9875
 It looks nice . 

5634. Probability: 0.9906
 sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? 

5635. Probability: 0.9792
 wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . 

5636. Probability: 0.9874
 You are lucky , sir . We are about to set out . It's a tour to the White House . 

5637. Probability: 0.9863
 It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . 

5638. Probability: 0.9808
 Great . You can move in next Monday . Your first month's rent is due then . 

5639. Probability: 0.9722
May I see that ivory horse ? 

5640. Probability: 0.9798
 I'll take it . 

5641. Probability: 0.9906
 Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . 

5642. Probability: 0.9742
 We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon . 

5643. Probability: 0.9737
Taxi ! Taxi ! Could you help me load these luggage in the trunk ? 

5644. Probability: 0.9900
 How about this ... We can make it a working lunch this afternoon , and I'll order some Chinese food for delivery . It'll be my treat . 

5645. Probability: 0.9793
 Actually I do like Chinese ... Let's make it a date for Chop Suey and the Martin account at about twelve thirty . Does that sound good ? 

5646. Probability: 0.9877
 Great . I'll bring the food . 

5647. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5648. Probability: 0.9721
 Yes . I would like to go to New York for my Christmas vacation . 

5649. Probability: 0.9947
 That's fantastic . 

5650. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5651. Probability: 0.9808
 I agree . And it's very convenient . 

5652. Probability: 0.9986
 Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . 

5653. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5654. Probability: 0.9917
This shirt is really nice . 

5655. Probability: 0.9849
 You have a very good taste , sir . Would you like to try it on ? 

5656. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5657. Probability: 0.9941
 Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? 

5658. Probability: 0.9760
 Yes . It's an excellent system . 

5659. Probability: 0.9729
 Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? 

5660. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5661. Probability: 0.9795
 It's a big leather suitcase with my name ' Lily ' on it . 

5662. Probability: 0.9826
 No kidding ! When did that happen ? 

5663. Probability: 0.9981
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 

5664. Probability: 0.9749
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 

5665. Probability: 0.9708
 That would be very good of you , Mr . White . 

5666. Probability: 0.9801
 I ’ m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter . 

5667. Probability: 0.9991
 That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing ! 

5668. Probability: 0.9702
 I like xeroxing . 

5669. Probability: 0.9797
 Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... 

5670. Probability: 0.9789
 Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ? 

5671. Probability: 0.9978
 How about this one ? It's graceful in style . 

5672. Probability: 0.9944
 Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? 

5673. Probability: 0.9868
 All right . this suits my taste best . I'II take It . 

5674. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

5675. Probability: 0.9788
Well , this is certainly a nice place , Mr . Taylor . What sort of public transportation is nearby ? 

5676. Probability: 0.9955
 Great . Well , we ’ ll have to think about it , but the place looks great . 

5677. Probability: 0.9789
Wow , this is the famous Empire State Building . 

5678. Probability: 0.9776
That way they look longer . 

5679. Probability: 0.9989
 Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ? 

5680. Probability: 0.9748
 Why don't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ? 

5681. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5682. Probability: 0.9852
 Apple , banana and strawberry pie . 

5683. Probability: 0.9904
 I am sorry you don't like it , sir . But that's just the special point of the dish . 

5684. Probability: 0.9901
 What about cocktail ? 

5685. Probability: 0.9774
 OK . Let me try it . 

5686. Probability: 0.9721
 How about this one ? 

5687. Probability: 0.9755
 How about that one ? 

5688. Probability: 0.9906
 Yes . It ’ s nice . Can I try it on ? 

5689. Probability: 0.9715
 All right , I'll walk to the village and I'll get some meat . 

5690. Probability: 0.9857
 Good . By the way , who's going to cook the meat ? 

5691. Probability: 0.9794
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 

5692. Probability: 0.9948
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 

5693. Probability: 0.9840
 Yes , I can do that . 

5694. Probability: 0.9767
OK darling , I got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese ! 

5695. Probability: 0.9834
 Wait a minute , what's that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ? 

5696. Probability: 0.9951
 Honestly , it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time . 

5697. Probability: 0.9857
 I couldn't help laughing , either . 

5698. Probability: 0.9858
 Silk . You have a good taste . It's excellent for its handiness , elegance and beauty . 

5699. Probability: 0.9798
 Can I try it on ? 

5700. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

5701. Probability: 0.9798
 Yes . And Chinese style . 

5702. Probability: 0.9897
 How about oil or spray ? 

5703. Probability: 0.9903
 That ’ s very good . 

5704. Probability: 0.9913
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? 

5705. Probability: 0.9850
 Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? 

5706. Probability: 0.9867
 Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? 

5707. Probability: 0.9913
 That sounds perfect and just what I'm looking for . 

5708. Probability: 0.9761
 Forget about the coke . Let's drink some wine , shall we ? 

5709. Probability: 0.9924
 I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . 

5710. Probability: 0.9980
 Sure . This one here just came out . It's got great 3D graphics and a cool story line . It's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the Internet . 

5711. Probability: 0.9722
 This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ? 

5712. Probability: 0.9996
 This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular . 

5713. Probability: 0.9794
 Great , that ’ s why I ’ m here . 

5714. Probability: 0.9766
 Yeah . Can I look at this ring ? 

5715. Probability: 0.9747
 There's no price tag on this necklace . 

5716. Probability: 0.9977
 This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ? 

5717. Probability: 0.9849
 How about this pair ? They're well-made . 

5718. Probability: 0.9706
 Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? 

5719. Probability: 0.9852
 It's cooked with lemon and savored with rice . 

5720. Probability: 0.9904
 Sound nice , I will try it . 

5721. Probability: 0.9725
 French onion soup , sir , what dressing would you like for your salad ? 

5722. Probability: 0.9842
 With pleasure . I think we should go to the palace first . 

5723. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

5724. Probability: 0.9804
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 

5725. Probability: 0.9724
 Then open that window . Yeah , that one . 

5726. Probability: 0.9718
 Well , then . Would you send to Japan , please ? 

5727. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5728. Probability: 0.9769
 This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . 

5729. Probability: 0.9839
 That's good . 

5730. Probability: 0.9724
 That sounds alright . 

5731. Probability: 0.9723
 Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . 

5732. Probability: 0.9732
 Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .

5738. Probability: 0.9708
 A double cheeseburger sounds good . 

5739. Probability: 0.9804

 It looks good.But can I try it on ? 

5752. Probability: 0.9861
 I had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost . 

5753. Probability: 0.9777
 Wonderful . Then how many employers have you worked for ? 

5754. Probability: 0.9728
This is our best product . 

5755. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

5756. Probability: 0.9980
 That ’ s a good idea . 

5757. Probability: 0.9928
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room . 

5758. Probability: 0.9988
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . 

5759. Probability: 0.9765
 Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? 

5760. Probability: 0.9921
 This is the latest design for our products . The design of I-series keeps the fashion in a close way . The sales volume of the new product is about 50,000 per month .

 How nice ! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars ? 

5764. Probability: 0.9955
 Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some . 

5765. Probability: 0.9756
 They're quite nice . But I'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive . 

5766. Probability: 0.9924
 Oh ! It's perfect . I think I'll take it . Would you wrap it , please ? 

5767. Probability: 0.9860
 Okay , sounds good . 

5768. Probability: 0.9716
 Okay , I ’ ll take this one.Does it come with batteries and a case ? 

5769. Probability: 0.9772
 Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . 

5770. Probability: 0.9804
 Let ’ s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! 

5771. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

5772. Probability: 0.9773
 That's our pleasure . Mr . Ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . And I hope Mr.Halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . Remember me to him , please . 

5773. Probability: 0.9905
 I really liked it ! 

5774. Probability: 0.9880
 I enjoyed the fish the most . 

5775. Probability: 0.9936
 The fish was pretty special , but I loved the dessert . 

5776. Probability: 0.9979
 The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world ! 

5777. Probability: 0.9895
 Yes , the service really added to the experience . 

5778. Probability: 0.9745
 I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant . 

5779. Probability: 0.9860
 Ah , that's all part of the fun . What do you think of these shorts ? 

5780. Probability: 0.9850
 They are . I think I'm going to get a hat too . 

5781. Probability: 0.9750
 Okay . I chose this swimming suit . Do you like it ? 

5782. Probability: 0.9812
 Wow . You look great . 

5783. Probability: 0.9712
 One is a small-size Nike in red and the other is a big one in black . The two are tied together . 

5784. Probability: 0.9810
Can I try this dress on ? 

5785. Probability: 0.9712
You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . 

5786. Probability: 0.9784
 Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . 

5787. Probability: 0.9985
 Great idea . 

5788. Probability: 0.9811
 It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . 

5789. Probability: 0.9726
 What about cigarettes or cigars ? 

5790. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

5791. Probability: 0.9993
 Sure , let's take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . 

5792. Probability: 0.9821
 Well , it was definitely worth all the time . 

5793. Probability: 0.9779
 Well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m . , and I'll arrive at 10 a . m . Shall we say 11 o'clock ? 

5794. Probability: 0.9784

 Great . I'll see you on the 7th . 

5796. Probability: 0.9717

5797. Probability: 0.9837
 That sounds good to me . I'll have the same . 

5798. Probability: 0.9780
 Now have you ever thought of going by express bus ? 

5799. Probability: 0.9750
 Yes . I made it this afternoon . Would you like some more ? 

5800. Probability: 0.9881
 It's good , try it . What do you think ? 

5801. Probability: 0.9965
 Wow . It is good . Did you make that also ? 

5802. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5803. Probability: 0.9918
 You're a really good cook . 

5804. Probability: 0.9730
 Thanks , next time I'll make chicken soup for us . 

5805. Probability: 0.9831
 That sounds good . Did you study cooking in school ? 

5806. Probability: 0.9916
 That will be gorgeous ! 

5807. Probability: 0.9831
 Wow . You guys never take a break ! I want to come in and have a look at your sale . Your sale is still on , isn't it ?

5815. Probability: 0.9780
Hey , The Cosby Show is on ! 

5816. Probability: 0.9860
 It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of citrusy . 

5817. Probability: 0.9823
 That sounds fine to me . 

5818. Probability: 0.9934
 Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ? 

5819. Probability: 0.9746
 Sure ! My number is 626-555-1739 . 

5820. Probability: 0.9777
 OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! 

5821. Probability: 0.9831

5822. Probability: 0.9789
 You ’ re such a geek ! 

5823. Probability: 0.9702
 Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called . 

5824. Probability: 0.9709
 I'm throwing a party next Saturday . 

5825. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

5826. Probability: 0.9873
 Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then . 

5827. Probability: 0.9759
 Ok . Thanks for that ! 

5828. Probability: 0.9867
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 

5829. Probability: 0.9870
 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 

5830. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

5831. Probability: 0.9847
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . 

5832. Probability: 0.9793
 Yes , I like it very much . 

5833. Probability: 0.9969
 Wow , a real step up ! 

5834. Probability: 0.9754
 You might send it as'Printed Matter ' . 

5835. Probability: 0.9800
 Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . 

5836. Probability: 0.9859
 Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? 

5837. Probability: 0.9798
 I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? 

5838. Probability: 0.9807
 Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . 

5839. Probability: 0.9958
 Perfect ! I'll take it ! 

5840. Probability: 0.9829
 Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day .

5844. Probability: 0.9707
 I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair . 

5845. Probability: 0.9730
 Yes , go down the fifth street . You won't miss it . 

5846. Probability: 0.9937
 Sure , but the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! 

5847. Probability: 0.9877
 Jane , I appreciate it very much . I expect to see you get nominated pretty soon , too . You've been doing some great work ! 

5848. Probability: 0.9788
 1,000 Yuan ? That's great ! So ... 

5849. Probability: 0.9850
 Really ? Can I order anything I want ?

 Yes , sir . How about the sideburns ? 

5854. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5855. Probability: 0.9847
 That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . 

5856. Probability: 0.9815
 Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? 

5857. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

5858. Probability: 0.9856
 I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults . 

5859. Probability: 0.9869
Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . 

5860. Probability: 0.9705
 Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . 

5861. Probability: 0.9973
 That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? 

5862. Probability: 0.9763
 I'd be glad to . He's really cute . 

5863. Probability: 0.9853
 Purple . But today , I'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour . 

5864. Probability: 0.9706
 Yes , I see . How do you like this one ? 

5865. Probability: 0.9712
 May I have a try ? 

5866. Probability: 0.9721
 How about this one ? 

5867. Probability: 0.9923
 Oh , that's the very thing I need . 

5868. Probability: 0.9749
I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen , high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . 

5869. Probability: 0.9757
 What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . 

5870. Probability: 0.9776
 It's a bit small but looks nice.What ' s more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . 

5871. Probability: 0.9717
 I can wash my clothes for less money here . 

5872. Probability: 0.9909
 Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? 

5873. Probability: 0.9969
 Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? 

5874. Probability: 0.9811
 Try something new . We can find a supporting agency . 

5875. Probability: 0.9993
 Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism . 

5876. Probability: 0.9800
 How about having a beer on the weekend ? 

5877. Probability: 0.9979
 Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? 

5878. Probability: 0.9869
 Sounds like it was ment to be .

5882. Probability: 0.9956
 I know , it does sound pretty awesome . 

5883. Probability: 0.9768
 I think you've got a real bargain . 

5884. Probability: 0.9888
 Let me stretch it for you . How is that now ? 

5885. Probability: 0.9761
 Yes , it fits all right now . I'll take it . Please put it in a bag and I'll take along . 

5886. Probability: 0.9867
 That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . 

5887. Probability: 0.9801
 How about Thursday ? 

5888. Probability: 0.9897
 Good ! 

5889. Probability: 0.9970
 Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . 

5890. Probability: 0.9825
 Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton . 

5891. Probability: 0.9984
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . 

5892. Probability: 0.9911
 Okay , it sounds good . 

5893. Probability: 0.9822
 That sounds good . How much is the tour ? 

5894. Probability: 0.9744
 Yes , of course . I live near the university . Hop in please .

 Great . Where can I get an application form ? 

5903. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

5904. Probability: 0.9796
 May I try it on ? 

5905. Probability: 0.9838
 You look really beautiful in it . 

5906. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

5907. Probability: 0.9903
 Let's see . How about a nice shirt and tie ? You can't go wrong there . 

5908. Probability: 0.9921
 I like them . Do you have matching belts ? 

5909. Probability: 0.9920
 That sounds great . I'll take them . 

5910. Probability: 0.9774
 Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . 

5911. Probability: 0.9883
 Thanks . That is a good suggestion . 

5912. Probability: 0.9729
My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month . 

5913. Probability: 0.9888
 And this espresso looks like ... oil ! 

5914. Probability: 0.9951
 Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ” 

5915. Probability: 0.9858
 Now , move the couch around and turn it upside down . 

5916. Probability: 0.9725
 Better than ever ! You won ’ t have to worry about “ finding ” extra money for me anymore ! We made nearly a quarter of million in profit last year ! 

5917. Probability: 0.9958
 Your dream will come true.It ' s really breathtaking . 

5918. Probability: 0.9838
 I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you . 

5919. Probability: 0.9945
 Yes , I finally have an inspiration . 

5920. Probability: 0.9883
 Good for you . No problem , I'll listen to the car radio 

5921. Probability: 0.9710
 A barber shop ? ! 

5922. Probability: 0.9736
 What kind of snack are you going to make ? 

5923. Probability: 0.9849
 I may just do that . 

5924. Probability: 0.9840
 Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . 

5925. Probability: 0.9821
 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 

5926. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

5927. Probability: 0.9831
 Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? 

5928. Probability: 0.9947
 Shoot ! 

5929. Probability: 0.9837
 Oh , you actually do that ?

 I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . 

5937. Probability: 0.9778
 Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . 

5938. Probability: 0.9764
 It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal . 

5939. Probability: 0.9865
 I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken . 

5940. Probability: 0.9858
 What about grapes and water melons ? 

5941. Probability: 0.9939
 Levis . It's the latest fashion . 

5942. Probability: 0.9713
 That's all right.Show me the blue pen , please .

5945. Probability: 0.9973
 Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ?

 You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .

 That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? 

6365. Probability: 0.9873
 Yes , I do.That looks good . It's not too short.It ' s just right . How much do I owe you ? 

6366. Probability: 0.9951
 We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special . 

6367. Probability: 0.9872
 I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers ! 

6368. Probability: 0.9869
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean . 

6369. Probability: 0.9800
 We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like . 

6370. Probability: 0.9734
 It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia ! 

6371. Probability: 0.9844
 Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ? 

6372. Probability: 0.9959
 Certainly.It has been specially treated . 

6373. Probability: 0.9732
 Please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 

6374. Probability: 0.9780
 Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 

6375. Probability: 0.9946
That dog has white long hair . It ’ s lovely . 

6376. Probability: 0.9961
 Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . 

6377. Probability: 0.9764
 Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade . 

6378. Probability: 0.9868
 So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . 

6379. Probability: 0.9942
 Really ? That's great ! Tell me . 

6380. Probability: 0.9857
 I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try . 

6381. Probability: 0.9965
 Good idea . I will think it over . 

6382. Probability: 0.9747
 I ’ m so happy that he did . 

6383. Probability: 0.9718
 Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . 

6384. Probability: 0.9987
 That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ? 

6385. Probability: 0.9895
 Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it . 

6386. Probability: 0.9743
 Can I try it ? 

6387. Probability: 0.9942
 Not bad . Actually , it makes me look younger . I like it . 

6388. Probability: 0.9958
 Try the lipstick as well . See , how fresh and charming you look . 

6389. Probability: 0.9739
Look ! Allen has the mic ! 

6390. Probability: 0.9799
 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself ! 

6391. Probability: 0.9942
 And he can move . too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! 

6392. Probability: 0.9954
 Sure Paula , shoot ! 

6393. Probability: 0.9883
 Oh , good . 

6394. Probability: 0.9814
 Taxi ! ! ! 

6395. Probability: 0.9728
 Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 

6396. Probability: 0.9977
 I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . 

6397. Probability: 0.9708
 Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? 

6398. Probability: 0.9760
 So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? 

6399. Probability: 0.9940
This is exciting ! Thank you so much ! 

6400. Probability: 0.9799
 My pleasure . Release the parking brake , and we're almost ready to go . 

6401. Probability: 0.9989
 Boy oh , boy ! This is so cool . Let's rock and roll ! 

6402. Probability: 0.9868
 Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for . 

6403. Probability: 0.9840
 It looks good on you . 

6404. Probability: 0.9747
 Great . What about the surrounding area ? 

6405. Probability: 0.9738
 That ’ s good . Is the location easily accessible ? 

6406. Probability: 0.9858
 Hmm . . . well , maybe we can buy this one then . 

6407. Probability: 0.9798
 Can I try it on ? 

6408. Probability: 0.9855
 This is much better . How much is it ? 

6409. Probability: 0.9935
 That sounds good . I'll take the escalator . 

6410. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6411. Probability: 0.9988
 I think this route is quite interesting . How long does the tour last ? 

6412. Probability: 0.9925
 That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . 

6413. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6414. Probability: 0.9882
 Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! 

6415. Probability: 0.9770
I ’ d like to buy these shoes . 

6416. Probability: 0.9878
 That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it . 

6417. Probability: 0.9721
 I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan . 

6418. Probability: 0.9710
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . 

6419. Probability: 0.9760
Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 

6420. Probability: 0.9786
 Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . 

6421. Probability: 0.9837
 Here you go , honey , fried eggs . 

6422. Probability: 0.9866
 Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco . 

6423. Probability: 0.9962
 I love the dancing figures . I'll take this music box . 

6424. Probability: 0.9781
 Yes , I think you'll be very satisfied with that one . 

6425. Probability: 0.9708
 I sure did ! 

6426. Probability: 0.9705
 That's good , thank you . 

6427. Probability: 0.9921
 That ’ s great . 

6428. Probability: 0.9743
 What about $ 800 ? 

6429. Probability: 0.9902
 that sounds great . Do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ? 

6430. Probability: 0.9888
 let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi . 

6431. Probability: 0.9701
 I used to buy lunch every day from the International food stall at school . Every day was an adventure ! 

6432. Probability: 0.9794
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 

6433. Probability: 0.9906
 That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? 

6434. Probability: 0.9876
How nice these frames are ! 

6435. Probability: 0.9894
 Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ? 

6436. Probability: 0.9762
 I want to try on this pair . 

6437. Probability: 0.9791
 I think it suits you well . 

6438. Probability: 0.9802
 Yes , very . They make the trip in about an hour . 

6439. Probability: 0.9986
 That's a good idea . 

6440. Probability: 0.9873
 Yes , this little boat gets up a fine speed , and I think we'll soon get to the land . 

6441. Probability: 0.9803
 Yes , it changed . 

6442. Probability: 0.9712
 Well , can I put something in this handbag ? 

6443. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

6444. Probability: 0.9949
 Absolutely . And it's a good way to kill time during the tour . 

6445. Probability: 0.9796
 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 

6446. Probability: 0.9792
 Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . 

6447. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

6448. Probability: 0.9888
 I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! 

6449. Probability: 0.9735
 Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine . 

6450. Probability: 0.9938
 Great ! As soon as I brush my teeth , I'll be downstairs . 

6451. Probability: 0.9806
 I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . 

6452. Probability: 0.9774
 Thank you very much , that's kind of you . 

6453. Probability: 0.9739
 Sure ! Right now , I would even eat hamburger ! 

6454. Probability: 0.9812
 Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne ? 

6455. Probability: 0.9910
 We have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ... 

6456. Probability: 0.9916
 Oh , really ? Thanks , I ’ m going to do that right now . 

6457. Probability: 0.9869
 Really ? You've done a good job . 

6458. Probability: 0.9815
 Yeah , let me have a try . 

6459. Probability: 0.9802
 It's better than picking up dog poop . 

6460. Probability: 0.9824
 I wish I had studied here . It's more than a university . 

6461. Probability: 0.9855
 Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” 

6462. Probability: 0.9801
Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? 

6463. Probability: 0.9798
 thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . 

6464. Probability: 0.9901
 that's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? 

6465. Probability: 0.9798
 Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? 

6466. Probability: 0.9941
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 

6467. Probability: 0.9805
 I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me . 

6468. Probability: 0.9990
 What about this one ? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it ? 

6469. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6470. Probability: 0.9776
 It's my pleasure ! 

6471. Probability: 0.9951
 That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? 

6472. Probability: 0.9938
 That's wonderful . 

6473. Probability: 0.9978
 It's really spectacular . 

6474. Probability: 0.9844
 I think we can climb to the top , can't we ? 

6475. Probability: 0.9726
 Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . 

6476. Probability: 0.9819
 That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ? 

6477. Probability: 0.9764
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units . 

6478. Probability: 0.9710
 Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith . 

6479. Probability: 0.9737
 That's perfect . 

6480. Probability: 0.9841
 It's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . 

6481. Probability: 0.9937
 Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? 

6482. Probability: 0.9907
 It's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back . 

6483. Probability: 0.9719
 Oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house . 

6484. Probability: 0.9924
 I'd be up for that ! 

6485. Probability: 0.9730
 Let's all go together then . 

6486. Probability: 0.9760
Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 

6487. Probability: 0.9786
 Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . 

6488. Probability: 0.9837
 Here you go , honey , fried eggs . 

6489. Probability: 0.9828
 Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? 

6490. Probability: 0.9883
 Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . 

6491. Probability: 0.9710
 That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . 

6492. Probability: 0.9749
 Great . Talk to you then . 

6493. Probability: 0.9739
 Well , let's move , I can see a rest area ahead.We can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ... 

6494. Probability: 0.9760
 So , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . No problem , jump on . 

6495. Probability: 0.9817
 I can do that . 

6496. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

6497. Probability: 0.9765
 Uh huh . How about a used car ? They've got good ones now . 

6498. Probability: 0.9858
 Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now . You'd feel so good driving a new car . 

6499. Probability: 0.9912
 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 

6500. Probability: 0.9967
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 

6501. Probability: 0.9718
Good coming , sir . 

6502. Probability: 0.9888
 Try having a car wash or selling candy . 

6503. Probability: 0.9957
 What a cool see-through blue ! How do you wear this thing ? 

6504. Probability: 0.9941
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 

6505. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6506. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6507. Probability: 0.9887
 Go and pick some stuff up . The price can always surprise foreign friends . 

6508. Probability: 0.9869
 Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . 

6509. Probability: 0.9859
 Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... 

6510. Probability: 0.9944
 Go for it . 

6511. Probability: 0.9828
 Great . Good luck . 

6512. Probability: 0.9733
 I will call the owners right now . They will be happy to hear the good news . 

6513. Probability: 0.9964
 You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . 

6514. Probability: 0.9745
 Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? 

6515. Probability: 0.9707
 How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? 

6516. Probability: 0.9931
 On the contrary ! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day . 

6517. Probability: 0.9749
 What about tomorrow evening ? 

6518. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6519. Probability: 0.9843
 It sounds good . I'll take that . 

6520. Probability: 0.9791
 At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ? 

6521. Probability: 0.9861
 Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year . 

6522. Probability: 0.9991
 That sounds really neat . Is there an extra charge for these swim stations ? 

6523. Probability: 0.9794
 I don't think you'll be disappointed . People really seem to like the swim stations . 

6524. Probability: 0.9854
 I know your friend will like the gift set , especially the teddy bear . 

6525. Probability: 0.9811
 Well , the teddy bear is for me ! 

6526. Probability: 0.9909
 I like one with flowers on its brim . 

6527. Probability: 0.9941
 That is great . Dinner starts at 6 

6528. Probability: 0.9924
your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? 

6529. Probability: 0.9769
 yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . 

6530. Probability: 0.9906
 sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . 

6531. Probability: 0.9849
 ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . 

6532. Probability: 0.9939
 Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice . 

6533. Probability: 0.9886
 And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing ! 

6534. Probability: 0.9983
 Oh , that's interesting ! 

6535. Probability: 0.9707
 Fruit juice , cakes and refreshments , and everything . 

6536. Probability: 0.9745
 Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time . 

6537. Probability: 0.9769
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak . 

6538. Probability: 0.9763
 Oh , I see . You like the Chinese style , don't you ? 

6539. Probability: 0.9725
 Yes , in the Chinese style . 

6540. Probability: 0.9897
 How about oil or spray ? 

6541. Probability: 0.9907
 That's very good ! 

6542. Probability: 0.9797
Hello . Do you like this jewelry ? I made most of these items myself . 

6543. Probability: 0.9896
 You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ? 

6544. Probability: 0.9726
 My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry . 

6545. Probability: 0.9798
 Me , too . But I could never make bracelets like these . 

6546. Probability: 0.9831
 I've been making these designs for over ten years . You can have a bracelet for ten dollars . 

6547. Probability: 0.9705
 It's a deal ! 

6548. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

6549. Probability: 0.9869
 Great ! Good luck . 

6550. Probability: 0.9973
 Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are . 

6551. Probability: 0.9812
 That sounds good . What's the charge ? 

6552. Probability: 0.9909
 Use my laptop in the lobby ? That's great ! Now , if I need to print something there ? 

6553. Probability: 0.9987
 Okay . That sounds like a winner . Now if I need to print something in the lobby ? 

6554. Probability: 0.9989
 That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . 

6555. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

6556. Probability: 0.9847
 That's great ! Thank you very much . 

6557. Probability: 0.9765
 I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . 

6558. Probability: 0.9823
 It seems that is a better way . Thank you . 

6559. Probability: 0.9726
 well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ? 

6560. Probability: 0.9718
 maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? 

6561. Probability: 0.9928
 you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . 

6562. Probability: 0.9903
 that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . 

6563. Probability: 0.9992
 That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 

6564. Probability: 0.9961
 Yeah , you should have . It was really exciting . 

6565. Probability: 0.9913
 That's what made it so great . 

6566. Probability: 0.9850
 You certainly made a good impression on me , as well . 

6567. Probability: 0.9950
That was delicious . 

6568. Probability: 0.9904
 Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . 

6569. Probability: 0.9859
 Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle . 

6570. Probability: 0.9918
 Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . 

6571. Probability: 0.9952
 That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ? 

6572. Probability: 0.9787
 Good . I will add this to the contract . 

6573. Probability: 0.9866
 I've always liked to draw and paint . 

6574. Probability: 0.9920
 I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint . 

6575. Probability: 0.9747
 Did you take some sort of art class or something ? 

6576. Probability: 0.9968
 That should be loads of fun . 

6577. Probability: 0.9786
 Yeah , let's do that . 

6578. Probability: 0.9877
 What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy . 

6579. Probability: 0.9828
 Very sweet . 

6580. Probability: 0.9874
 Great , thanks . 

6581. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

6582. Probability: 0.9782
 Of course ! Let me take it out of my wallet . 

6583. Probability: 0.9797
 Very good . Here is your room key , sir . If you need anything at all , please dial 0 . 

6584. Probability: 0.9786
 Sounds good . What are the gifts attaching ? 

6585. Probability: 0.9716
 Maybe that ’ s what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 

6586. Probability: 0.9943
 Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... 

6587. Probability: 0.9950
 Great ! 

6588. Probability: 0.9783
 ( After trying ) Mm , this pair fits me well . I'll take it . How much is it ? 

6589. Probability: 0.9817
 You are so lucky . They are on sale today . It costs only 250 yuan . Pay at the counter over there . 

6590. Probability: 0.9713
 It ’ s double A , R , O , N . 

6591. Probability: 0.9709
 Double A , R , O , N . Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I know your arrival time on April 16th ? 

6592. Probability: 0.9816
 Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . 

6593. Probability: 0.9829
 Oh , that's right . Renting is good ! 

6594. Probability: 0.9856
 Cool ! Can I come ? 

6595. Probability: 0.9716
 No . The front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ... 

6596. Probability: 0.9774
 Thanks very much and you're very eloquent . 

6597. Probability: 0.9714
 Thanks for saying that . 

6598. Probability: 0.9834
 Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? 

6599. Probability: 0.9980
 That's a great idea ; thanks for your help . 

6600. Probability: 0.9967
 It sounds wonderful . Do I have to sign a lease ? How much should I pay ? 

6601. Probability: 0.9956
 Well-done , please . 

6602. Probability: 0.9704
 Great . We will give you a chance to have an interview in our company . 

6603. Probability: 0.9759
 I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear . 

6604. Probability: 0.9744
Thank you for bringing me here Hong , this place looks great ! 

6605. Probability: 0.9842
 Let me see . How about the lotus root ? 

6606. Probability: 0.9852
 Oh , that ’ s a good choice . Very healthy too . 

6607. Probability: 0.9854
 Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower . 

6608. Probability: 0.9704
 Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here . 

6609. Probability: 0.9987
 That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? 

6610. Probability: 0.9794
 Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . 

6611. Probability: 0.9842
 I appreciate the effort , sir . 

6612. Probability: 0.9943
This apartment is wonderful . 

6613. Probability: 0.9774
 That sounds all right . 

6614. Probability: 0.9722
 That's great news . 

6615. Probability: 0.9774
 Here . Catch ! 

6616. Probability: 0.9777
 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias ! 

6617. Probability: 0.9938
 And he can move , too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! 

6618. Probability: 0.9828
I think this suit displays your nice finger . 

6619. Probability: 0.9715
 Yes ! And there are more bargains . See these pajamas ? If you buy a pair now , you get this teddy bear as a gift ! 

6620. Probability: 0.9978
 Oh ! It's so cute ! 

6621. Probability: 0.9717
 It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted . 

6622. Probability: 0.9752
 I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow . 

6623. Probability: 0.9982
 That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . 

6624. Probability: 0.9904
 That certainly is quite an accomplishment . 

6625. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

6626. Probability: 0.9711
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . 

6627. Probability: 0.9790
 Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . 

6628. Probability: 0.9873
 Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . 

6629. Probability: 0.9867
 That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . 

6630. Probability: 0.9755
 I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them . 

6631. Probability: 0.9987
 That ’ s a good idea . You have plenty of experience in marketing , don ’ t you ? 

6632. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6633. Probability: 0.9906
 That sounds good to me . 

6634. Probability: 0.9883
 Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread ! 

6635. Probability: 0.9855
 What about this one ? It fits you . 

6636. Probability: 0.9771
 Well , the style is quite good , but I think it's too showy . I would like to try on the lighter one . 

6637. Probability: 0.9833
 I think I would like that . 

6638. Probability: 0.9988
 It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting ! 

6639. Probability: 0.9777
 I borrowed it from Mike yesterday . Why not have a try ? 

6640. Probability: 0.9978
 That's neat ! 

6641. Probability: 0.9784
 Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . 

6642. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

6643. Probability: 0.9708
 But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . 

6644. Probability: 0.9706
 Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? 

6645. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6646. Probability: 0.9722
 Really ? I'm glad to hear that . 

6647. Probability: 0.9793
 Yes , we really enjoyed it . 

6648. Probability: 0.9950
 Yes , that sounds great . 

6649. Probability: 0.9946
 Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials . 

6650. Probability: 0.9939
 The apple crisp sounds great . 

6651. Probability: 0.9982
 Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ? 

6652. Probability: 0.9991
 That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? 

6653. Probability: 0.9793
 Well , we try ! Here , I just made some carrot juice . Would you like a glass ? 

6654. Probability: 0.9958
 Why not ! Before you know it , I'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head ! 

6655. Probability: 0.9886
 You don't have to go to the mountains ! I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning ! 

6656. Probability: 0.9915
 That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? 

6657. Probability: 0.9704
 That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . 

6658. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

6659. Probability: 0.9980
 Well , that was an intelligent thing to do . 

6660. Probability: 0.9966
 How beautiful ! I love it at all . 

6661. Probability: 0.9798
 It's very kind of you . I really don't know how I can thank you enough . 

6662. Probability: 0.9725
 Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? 

6663. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

6664. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

6665. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6666. Probability: 0.9765
 I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview . 

6667. Probability: 0.9988
 That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . 

6668. Probability: 0.9994
 Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . 

6669. Probability: 0.9864
 Well , why not dine out together and go to the moves . 

6670. Probability: 0.9976
 Sounds like a good idea . 

6671. Probability: 0.9776
 We have fruit cake , cream cake and chestnut cake . 

6672. Probability: 0.9776
 Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . 

6673. Probability: 0.9898
 That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . 

6674. Probability: 0.9708
OK darling , got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese ! 

6675. Probability: 0.9751
 Wait a minute , that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ? 

6676. Probability: 0.9754
 The rest of us will have this today's special , please . 

6677. Probability: 0.9972
 The one on the manikin is in fashion now . 

6678. Probability: 0.9811
 OK , here you are . You look really attractive in that gown . 

6679. Probability: 0.9954
 Boy , Todd , that was one great movie you picked out ! Thanks for asking me to go with you ! 

6680. Probability: 0.9737
 A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ? 

6681. Probability: 0.9903
 Linda , that would be a perfect addition . 

6682. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

6683. Probability: 0.9899
 Sure , why not . Sounds like fun . Why are you going to church ? 

6684. Probability: 0.9703
 Sure . How about this one ? 

6685. Probability: 0.9951
 But it ’ s so pretty . 

6686. Probability: 0.9858
 It ’ s not the same . It ’ s completely different . 

6687. Probability: 0.9957
 I really like this one . 

6688. Probability: 0.9872
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty . 

6689. Probability: 0.9784
 The dress is slim in cut . 

6690. Probability: 0.9754
 Thank you for saying that . 

6691. Probability: 0.9908
 It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week . 

6692. Probability: 0.9757
 Sure , Stacy . Let me just grab my coat . 

6693. Probability: 0.9990
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ? 

6694. Probability: 0.9752
 Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt . 

6695. Probability: 0.9749
 The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . 

6696. Probability: 0.9852
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 

6697. Probability: 0.9723
 Ha-ha . Last night , I only told him practice makes perfect . 

6698. Probability: 0.9740
 Yeah , it will become a wider trend . 

6699. Probability: 0.9776
 Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course . 

6700. Probability: 0.9729
 Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ? 

6701. Probability: 0.9761
 Ha ! Ha ! If you don ’ t make an effort now , later on it ’ ll be a lot tougher for you . 

6702. Probability: 0.9719
 That will be good . 

6703. Probability: 0.9928
 That ’ s great ! 

6704. Probability: 0.9751
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 

6705. Probability: 0.9844
 Dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can . 

6706. Probability: 0.9922
 Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . 

6707. Probability: 0.9771
Excuse me , I'd like to make a suit of this material . 

6708. Probability: 0.9779
 I see . How about buying and selling items ? 

6709. Probability: 0.9766
 Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! 

6710. Probability: 0.9906
 Perfect . Thanks ! 

6711. Probability: 0.9709
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . 

6712. Probability: 0.9752
 Not bad , thanks ! Our company has sent me to pick you up here . 

6713. Probability: 0.9703
 That is so nice of you . 

6714. Probability: 0.9843
 It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of acidity . 

6715. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

6716. Probability: 0.9812
 A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood . 

6717. Probability: 0.9837
 Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny . 

6718. Probability: 0.9725
Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? 

6719. Probability: 0.9831
 Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . 

6720. Probability: 0.9937
 Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? 

6721. Probability: 0.9907
 They are too bright . 

6722. Probability: 0.9934
 Great . 

6723. Probability: 0.9988
 Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . 

6724. Probability: 0.9756
 Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ? 

6725. Probability: 0.9872
 Sure , why not ? 

6726. Probability: 0.9713
 I am thinking about the popcorn shrimp . How is that ? 

6727. Probability: 0.9922
 That would be a great choice ! 

6728. Probability: 0.9855
 Maybe I'll run away first . 

6729. Probability: 0.9932
 Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best . 

6730. Probability: 0.9848
 Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . 

6731. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6732. Probability: 0.9976
 Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers . 

6733. Probability: 0.9915
 And a good way to get some pocket money . 

6734. Probability: 0.9727
 I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card . 

6735. Probability: 0.9774
 Sure . In the middle part of the fifth street , there is a Phoenix Restaurant . Maybe you can go there . 

6736. Probability: 0.9927
Honey . The cottages harmonize well with the landscape.That tourist resort is worth travelling to . 

6737. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

6738. Probability: 0.9914
 That's great . 

6739. Probability: 0.9781
 Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day ! 

6740. Probability: 0.9756
 The water wagon . 

6741. Probability: 0.9910
 Well , let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 

6742. Probability: 0.9720
 Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . 

6743. Probability: 0.9781
 That's very kind of you . 

6744. Probability: 0.9960
 No wonder his son is so clever . 

6745. Probability: 0.9931
 Okay , here's a new one for you . 

6746. Probability: 0.9749
 Okay , I'll take it out front right now . 

6747. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6748. Probability: 0.9877
 No , I don't like short hair . I like this one . The wave looks beautiful , and it fits my age too . 

6749. Probability: 0.9936
 Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? 

6750. Probability: 0.9897
 Good ! 

6751. Probability: 0.9954
 That sounds great ! 

6752. Probability: 0.9701
 Thank you so much . That's very kind of you . 

6753. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

6754. Probability: 0.9781
 It's delicious . 

6755. Probability: 0.9965
Hi , Steven . You have finished a wonderful project recently . 

6756. Probability: 0.9953
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 

6757. Probability: 0.9726
 Thanks , Karen . 

6758. Probability: 0.9906
 It's a pleasure . 

6759. Probability: 0.9939
 that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . 

6760. Probability: 0.9859
 How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ? 

6761. Probability: 0.9846
 On this evening's dessert list , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp . 

6762. Probability: 0.9897
 I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful . 

6763. Probability: 0.9780
 How about some coffee and tea as well ? 

6764. Probability: 0.9843
 What about jeans ? It's the fashion now . 

6765. Probability: 0.9734
 Fruit juice , cake and refreshments and everything . 

6766. Probability: 0.9939
 Yes . Baked eggs and buttered toast . I like my baker very crazy . 

6767. Probability: 0.9802
 Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill . 

6768. Probability: 0.9803
 Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first . 

6769. Probability: 0.9924
 How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . 

6770. Probability: 0.9992
 Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . 

6771. Probability: 0.9704
 Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids . 

6772. Probability: 0.9781
 Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic . 

6773. Probability: 0.9789
 OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning . 

6774. Probability: 0.9869
 Yeah . You can take them home and either use them as a gift or keep them as mementoes . 

6775. Probability: 0.9979
 You know , I saw that and it looks pretty good ! 

6776. Probability: 0.9729
 Let ’ s go check it out again ! 

6777. Probability: 0.9903
 That's great . This is your key , sir . If you need anything at all , anytime , just dial zero . 

6778. Probability: 0.9975
 That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . 

6779. Probability: 0.9974
 I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them . 

6780. Probability: 0.9932
 Oh , can I keep this little suitcase as hand-luggage ? 

6781. Probability: 0.9866
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . 

6782. Probability: 0.9923
 Yes , everything has been well designed . 

6783. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6784. Probability: 0.9931
 That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ? 

6785. Probability: 0.9928
 Oh , very good . 

6786. Probability: 0.9907
 That's smart thinking . 

6787. Probability: 0.9831
 I'll take this one . 

6788. Probability: 0.9724
 Yes , give me two rolls of Kodak color film . 

6789. Probability: 0.9985
 Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . 

6790. Probability: 0.9904
 That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . 

6791. Probability: 0.9801
 Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . 

6792. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6793. Probability: 0.9758
 It's my pleasure . 

6794. Probability: 0.9736
 Just kidding , M . Why don't you come work out with me ? 

6795. Probability: 0.9850
 This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night . 

6796. Probability: 0.9834
Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . 

6797. Probability: 0.9878
 Maybe . Oh , I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting . 

6798. Probability: 0.9980
 Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . 

6799. Probability: 0.9946
 Good , you can make your dream come true here . 

6800. Probability: 0.9739
 Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . 

6801. Probability: 0.9890
 I enjoyed it , even though I had not asked for it . 

6802. Probability: 0.9889
 Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? 

6803. Probability: 0.9826

Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . 

6804. Probability: 0.9974
 Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? 

6805. Probability: 0.9840
 We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . 

6806. Probability: 0.9898
 Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... 

6807. Probability: 0.9821
 Perhaps you could give her a ring ? 

6808. Probability: 0.9826
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! 

6809. Probability: 0.9982
 Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . 

6810. Probability: 0.9821
 So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . 

6811. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6812. Probability: 0.9777
 Those are beautiful . Do you have any in a size six ? 

6813. Probability: 0.9993

6819. Probability: 0.9933
 Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . 

6820. Probability: 0.9751
Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! 

6821. Probability: 0.9775
 That's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . 

6822. Probability: 0.9839
 Great . Bye . 

6823. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6824. Probability: 0.9740
 I appreciate the offer . I will come on time next Monday . See you then ! 

6825. Probability: 0.9721
 How about this one ? 

6826. Probability: 0.9973
 That ’ s fantastic ! You really got me there . 

6827. Probability: 0.9827
 And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . 

6828. Probability: 0.9720
 Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . 

6829. Probability: 0.9798
 Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? 

6830. Probability: 0.9809
 Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! 

6831. Probability: 0.9903
 Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . 

6832. Probability: 0.9901
 No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . 

6833. Probability: 0.9836
 Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . 

6834. Probability: 0.9747
 How about some Zongzi ? 

6835. Probability: 0.9938
 Well , it's a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves . 

6836. Probability: 0.9937
 That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that . 

6837. Probability: 0.9783
 That would be great ! How about 2:30 ? 

6838. Probability: 0.9984
I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? 

6839. Probability: 0.9849
 Very good . How many goods do you have ? 

6840. Probability: 0.9820
 I'd like that . 

6841. Probability: 0.9944
 They took advantage of the blackout . 

6842. Probability: 0.9920
 Wonderful . Thanks very much . 

6843. Probability: 0.9893
 I could do that . 

6844. Probability: 0.9957
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . 

6845. Probability: 0.9721
 How about this one ? 

6846. Probability: 0.9876
 Really ? I will take it . 

6847. Probability: 0.9923
 go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . 

6848. Probability: 0.9895
that was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . 

6849. Probability: 0.9887
 I made strawberry shortcake . 

6850. Probability: 0.9926
 ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . 

6851. Probability: 0.9888
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? 

6852. Probability: 0.9938
 That ’ s fabulous . Thank you very much . 

6853. Probability: 0.9703
 Can you go wake up Cindy for me ? 

6854. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

6855. Probability: 0.9941
 That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . 

6856. Probability: 0.9833
 I think that would be perfect . 

6857. Probability: 0.9719
 She's going to be so happy . Let me have one . 

6858. Probability: 0.9706
 You've made a good decision . How would you like to pay ? 

6859. Probability: 0.9989
 Good idea . We can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning . 

6860. Probability: 0.9932
 That ’ s great . Thanks for the ride . I really appreciate 1 it . You know my car is still in the shop . 

6861. Probability: 0.9776
 It's very nice of you . 

6862. Probability: 0.9831
 I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . 

6863. Probability: 0.9769
 Perhaps it's the starter then ? 

6864. Probability: 0.9776
 Yes , that's possible . 

6865. Probability: 0.9795
Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! 

6866. Probability: 0.9737
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 

6867. Probability: 0.9804
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ? 

6868. Probability: 0.9773
 Those bushes are covering the stop sign . 

6869. Probability: 0.9969
 Good idea . I'll get some , too . 

6870. Probability: 0.9796
 I think I'll get a hat , too . 

6871. Probability: 0.9776
 No hat for me , but I'm getting this cool pair of shades . 

6872. Probability: 0.9827
 Very Good . I will let him know as soon as he comes back . But , may I have your name , please ? 

6873. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

6874. Probability: 0.9872
 World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? 

6875. Probability: 0.9934
 Kristy , that's wonderful ! Thanks so much for contacting me personally . 

6876. Probability: 0.9963
 Yes . The baked fish was out of this world . 

6877. Probability: 0.9977
 Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? 

6878. Probability: 0.9963
 Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! 

6879. Probability: 0.9943
 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . 

6880. Probability: 0.9805
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 

6881. Probability: 0.9838
 Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun . 

6882. Probability: 0.9747
 that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? 

6883. Probability: 0.9716
 I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help . 

6884. Probability: 0.9795
 that ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot . 

6885. Probability: 0.9959
 Looks good . 

6886. Probability: 0.9888
 That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . 

6887. Probability: 0.9961
 All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! 

6888. Probability: 0.9718
 Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . 

6889. Probability: 0.9905
 Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . 

6890. Probability: 0.9950
 Why not try it on ? 

6891. Probability: 0.9725
 It's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ? 

6892. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

6893. Probability: 0.9722
 What about here in physical education ? 

6894. Probability: 0.9840
 Yeah . How about ' Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ' 

6895. Probability: 0.9852
 Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ? 

6896. Probability: 0.9994
 Ok . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . 

6897. Probability: 0.9939
 Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? 

6898. Probability: 0.9802
I want to go try on these clothes . 

6899. Probability: 0.9825
 Go and try it on . 

6900. Probability: 0.9886
 I love that shirt on you . 

6901. Probability: 0.9734
 What about the jeans ? 

6902. Probability: 0.9749
 That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you . 

6903. Probability: 0.9946
 That would be a good idea . 

6904. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

6905. Probability: 0.9916
 It is beautiful . 

6906. Probability: 0.9948
 I honestly love it . 

6907. Probability: 0.9906
 It's a pleasure . 

6908. Probability: 0.9712
 I'm going to do that . 

6909. Probability: 0.9823
 That sounds fine . 

6910. Probability: 0.9812
 Wow . You look great . 

6911. Probability: 0.9923
 That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? 

6912. Probability: 0.9947
 That makes sense . I'm going to try that . 

6913. Probability: 0.9715
 Well you have to try Peking duck . 

6914. Probability: 0.9981
 That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ? 

6915. Probability: 0.9918
 Quite right . If you don't confirm , the reservation will be cancelled 72 hours before the departure time . In order not to miss your flight , I think you should pick up your ticket as early as possible . 

6916. Probability: 0.9786
Hey ! Taxi . 

6917. Probability: 0.9969
 Wow , a real step up ! 

6918. Probability: 0.9822
Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! 

6919. Probability: 0.9711
 Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . 

6920. Probability: 0.9792
 Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation ! 

6921. Probability: 0.9835
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 

6922. Probability: 0.9721
 How about this one ? 

6923. Probability: 0.9883
 Thanks ! We love it . 

6924. Probability: 0.9941
 Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . 

6925. Probability: 0.9939
 I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . 

6926. Probability: 0.9869
 All right . That Nealy done a little . 

6927. Probability: 0.9883
 Oh , yes ! 

6928. Probability: 0.9842
 No kidding ! We have only 5 bottles of beer . 

6929. Probability: 0.9768
 You had champagne for the girl . 

6930. Probability: 0.9956
 People decided to use the blackout to their advantage . 

6931. Probability: 0.9806
 Very good . Now can you tell me the hours of operation ? 

6932. Probability: 0.9948
 Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks ! 

6933. Probability: 0.9703
 Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! 

6934. Probability: 0.9844
 Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! 

6935. Probability: 0.9969
 That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . 

6936. Probability: 0.9785
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? 

6937. Probability: 0.9797
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . 

6938. Probability: 0.9786
 Let's rock n ' roll . 

6939. Probability: 0.9914
 Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 

6940. Probability: 0.9861
 You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . 

6941. Probability: 0.9954
 Don't you think it's a bit bright ? 

6942. Probability: 0.9796
 Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ? 

6943. Probability: 0.9969
 No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated . 

6944. Probability: 0.9870
 How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? 

6945. Probability: 0.9994
 That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 

6946. Probability: 0.9986
 The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . 

6947. Probability: 0.9727
 Yes please . At 6.30 am . 

6948. Probability: 0.9847
 Good , I am sure it will work if you can persist . 

6949. Probability: 0.9918
 Sounds good ! 

6950. Probability: 0.9801
 well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! 

6951. Probability: 0.9808
 that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . 

6952. Probability: 0.9919
 It skips around . 

6953. Probability: 0.9751
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 

6954. Probability: 0.9854
 How about your sideburns ? 

6955. Probability: 0.9917
 Yeah , it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year . 

6956. Probability: 0.9951
 Exactly , it seems like it's going to be loads of fun . 

6957. Probability: 0.9752
 I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow . 

6958. Probability: 0.9973
 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . 

6959. Probability: 0.9724
 How about 50,000 RIB . Would that be a problem ? 

6960. Probability: 0.9973
 Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides . 

6961. Probability: 0.9866
 What about roses ? 

6962. Probability: 0.9828
 As many as you like , sir . They are beautiful , aren't they ? 

6963. Probability: 0.9818
 What about Next Monday ? 

6964. Probability: 0.9952
 Oh , that's nice . Thank you for arranging all of this . 

6965. Probability: 0.9786
 How about textile industry ? 

6966. Probability: 0.9733
 That's surprising , three days ago when I went to yancheng store , I saw different kinds of textile goods . I've bought some for my wife , some for my friends.they seem very attractive . 

6967. Probability: 0.9975
 That sounds like a good idea ! 

6968. Probability: 0.9956
 I think this one fits you . It's the new fashion style . 

6969. Probability: 0.9832
 Oh , yes . That's just the one I want . I will take it . 

6970. Probability: 0.9840
Can I try this lipstick ? 

6971. Probability: 0.9708
 Sure . Here is the mirror . 

6972. Probability: 0.9817
 I like the color . 

6973. Probability: 0.9721
 Let's take a cab . 

6974. Probability: 0.9878
 That ’ s great . How much is it ? 

6975. Probability: 0.9771
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an order for 10,000 pieces . 

6976. Probability: 0.9833
 Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe . 

6977. Probability: 0.9714
How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? 

6978. Probability: 0.9701
 Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ? 

6979. Probability: 0.9935
 Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . 

6980. Probability: 0.9931
 That sounds great . I'll have that one then . 

6981. Probability: 0.9957
 She is a great addition to my class . 

6982. Probability: 0.9915
 Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? 

6983. Probability: 0.9748
 Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . 

6984. Probability: 0.9969
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 

6985. Probability: 0.9919
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 

6986. Probability: 0.9743
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 

6987. Probability: 0.9824
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 

6988. Probability: 0.9978
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 

6989. Probability: 0.9812
 That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . 

6990. Probability: 0.9719
 Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . 

6991. Probability: 0.9874
 Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . 

6992. Probability: 0.9869
 There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . 

6993. Probability: 0.9972
 Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? 

6994. Probability: 0.9960
 That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . 

6995. Probability: 0.9732
 Party of two ? 

6996. Probability: 0.9791
How about we go to the flea market today ? 

6997. Probability: 0.9813
 Great . I have long been looking forward to there . 

6998. Probability: 0.9896
 Why don't you try it and see what happens ? 

6999. Probability: 0.9717
 I'll try it right now . 

7000. Probability: 0.9743
 Yes , I am . I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it . 

7001. Probability: 0.9758
 Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ? 

7002. Probability: 0.9890
 That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ? 

7003. Probability: 0.9924
 It sounds good . 

7004. Probability: 0.9889
 Really ? Let me have a try . 

7005. Probability: 0.9920
 What a thoughtful granddad ! Do you have her account details with you ? 

7006. Probability: 0.9837
 Not just a thoughtful granddad , but a generous one too .

 All right . Give me a big smile . Are you ready ? Cheese ! 

7029. Probability: 0.9870
 They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks .

You won't believe what just happened . 

7036. Probability: 0.9727

7037. Probability: 0.9852
 This all looks good ! I think we know what we want . 

7038. Probability: 0.9934
 The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice . 

7039. Probability: 0.9716
 Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ? 

7040. Probability: 0.9840
 This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price .

 Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal !

7050. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7051. Probability: 0.9806
 That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? 

7052. Probability: 0.9773
 Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision . 

7053. Probability: 0.9714
Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ...

 Yeah.What a surprise ! 

7059. Probability: 0.9845
 Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all ! 

7060. Probability: 0.9796
 Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . 

7061. Probability: 0.9720
 I would like that . 

7062. Probability: 0.9955
 Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable . 

7063. Probability: 0.9774
 It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? 

7064. Probability: 0.9996
Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . 

7065. Probability: 0.9857
 I can see that you are a smart buyer . Forty thousand is my best price . 

7066. Probability: 0.9986
 Yeah , that ’ s a good idea , and you like to cook . What about the books ? 

7067. Probability: 0.9703
 O . K . Let ’ s compromise , if you agree to only spend $ 75 on books , I ’ ll agree to only spend $ 40 for my next shirt . 

7068. Probability: 0.9930
 It was a great game . 

7069. Probability: 0.9937
 It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different . 

7070. Probability: 0.9772
 OK , I'd like to try it today . 

7071. Probability: 0.9755
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? 

7072. Probability: 0.9796
 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 

7073. Probability: 0.9708
 Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? 

7074. Probability: 0.9984
 That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 

7075. Probability: 0.9758
 It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . 

7076. Probability: 0.9978
 It can also entertain your passengers like me . 

7077. Probability: 0.9847

7081. Probability: 0.9789
 That would be great . 

7082. Probability: 0.9719
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 

7083. Probability: 0.9834
 And here is Buckingham Palace ! Look , isn't it beautiful ? It is much bigger than I imagined . 

7084. Probability: 0.9981
 This is amazing . I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour . So where next ? 

7085. Probability: 0.9945
 Wonderful . 

7086. Probability: 0.9861
 Oh , that's a really good buy ... Here . There's only one left . 

7087. Probability: 0.9894
That's great ! We made 20 minutes earlier . 

7088. Probability: 0.9832
 Hey , look there . It is an advertisement of the piano training class on the billboard . The place is not far from our home . 

7089. Probability: 0.9830
 Why ? Why not ! The piano is right there . 

7090. Probability: 0.9832
Mary , this company is pretty good . I really want to have an interview . 

7091. Probability: 0.9724

 I want to book a tour with adventure sports . 

7093. Probability: 0.9754
 Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge . 

7094. Probability: 0.9902
 I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey ! 

7095. Probability: 0.9835
 I want to put this curtain up .

7106. Probability: 0.9917
 Visual C + + , C and Delphi . 

7107. Probability: 0.9707
 Then , how about this room with just a shower ? 

7108. Probability: 0.9977
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 

7109. Probability: 0.9703
 No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too . 

7110. Probability: 0.9859
 That ’ s a good decision . They have many good job search tools there . 

7111. Probability: 0.9813
 Well , it's good in style , but I am afraid it doesn't wash well . 

7112. Probability: 0.9855
 come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! 

7113. Probability: 0.9959

7118. Probability: 0.9939
 Oh , that's good . 

7119. Probability: 0.9945
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . 

7120. Probability: 0.9907
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees . 

7121. Probability: 0.9894
 That's very generous . 

7122. Probability: 0.9934
 Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ?

 Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . 

7140. Probability: 0.9953
 Well , it's quite different from the Chinese food . 

7141. Probability: 0.9724
 Oh , hop in . 

7142. Probability: 0.9717
 How about afternoon ? 

7143. Probability: 0.9970

7144. Probability: 0.9914
What a lovely tapestry ! Don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ? 

7145. Probability: 0.9712
 I think we can have a try . 

7146. Probability: 0.9944
 Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style . 

7147. Probability: 0.9765
 I see . Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? 

7148. Probability: 0.9881
 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 

7149. Probability: 0.9774
 well , I think you should come and have some fun . Besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . You should at least try .

7160. Probability: 0.9788
 How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . 

7161. Probability: 0.9761
 Let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities . 

7162. Probability: 0.9900
 Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . 

7163. Probability: 0.9825
 I have never been on this bus , but I'm sure it's the right one .

7168. Probability: 0.9803
You did an excellent job in this project . 

7169. Probability: 0.9786
 But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 

7170. Probability: 0.9941
 I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one . 

7171. Probability: 0.9878
 It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie ! 

7172. Probability: 0.9866
 But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside . 

7173. Probability: 0.9985
 A fly-away tie ! What a riot ! 

7174. Probability: 0.9859
 Yes , the food you have just sent here is cool.Would you please heat them up ?

Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! 

7195. Probability: 0.9867
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career !

 Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food . 

7221. Probability: 0.9816
 Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . 

7222. Probability: 0.9849
 What about veggies ?

 It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait !

 That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it . 

7230. Probability: 0.9713
 I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ? 

7231. Probability: 0.9977
 Good idea . It is convenient and fast . 

7232. Probability: 0.9811
 Oh , that ’ s right . Is that time of the year , huh ? That ’ s fine . How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ?

 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed , we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . 

7244. Probability: 0.9713
 Well , let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! 

7245. Probability: 0.9727
 In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then . 

7246. Probability: 0.9986
 That's a good idea . 

7247. Probability: 0.9986
 That's a good idea .

 that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . 

7296. Probability: 0.9711

You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! 

7322. Probability: 0.9807
 Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . 

7323. Probability: 0.9884
 That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . 

7324. Probability: 0.9949
 Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! 

7325. Probability: 0.9911
 Come on baby , let's dance ! 

7326. Probability: 0.9986
 That's a good idea . 

7327. Probability: 0.9827
 I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . 

7328. Probability: 0.9756
 Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! 

7329. Probability: 0.9912
 It sounds great . I will arrange an interview tomorrow . Can you come tomorrow ? 

7330. Probability: 0.9798
 Me too , Todd ! Thanks for suggesting that great movie . 

7331. Probability: 0.9864
 I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday . 

7332. Probability: 0.9956
 Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion . 

7333. Probability: 0.9721
 All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon .

 What flight has seats available to Milan on this Sunday ? 

7335. Probability: 0.9945
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . 

7336. Probability: 0.9896
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers . 

7337. Probability: 0.9787
 The Old Town , the Distillery Historic District , the Financial District and Underground City , everything is so attractive . 

7338. Probability: 0.9904
 How about the eggplant and minced pork in dry red chili sauce and the ' Tofu ' beancurd ? They are our specialties . 

7339. Probability: 0.9700
 Yes . Sour soup of Sichuan style . It's our chef ’ s recommendation . 

7340. Probability: 0.9930
 It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient . 

7341. Probability: 0.9930
 It's seriously good . 

7342. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , I have got some special local product , I want to take them for my friends .

 Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called .

7348. Probability: 0.9829

I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I have got some idea of your exports . I am interested in your silk blouses . 

7349. Probability: 0.9938
 Our silks are known for their quality . They are one of our traditional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand . 

7350. Probability: 0.9886
 Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish business relationship with you .

 That's a good idea . That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves .

 How about sick days ? 

7354. Probability: 0.9794
 Great . Thanks so much for your time . 

7355. Probability: 0.9714
 So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .

 Good idea .

7388. Probability: 0.9917
Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! 

7389. Probability: 0.9928
 You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . 

7390. Probability: 0.9887
 Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . 

7391. Probability: 0.9902
 Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality .

 That's a good idea !

 Great . What name shall I put the reservation under ? 

7400. Probability: 0.9906
 It's a pleasure . 

7401. Probability: 0.9982
 Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect .

 Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken .

 Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 

7408. Probability: 0.9972
 That ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . 

7409. Probability: 0.9739
 But somebody told me this was the right bus to take . I want to go to Tian'anmen Square , you see . 

7410. Probability: 0.9889

7415. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7416. Probability: 0.9830
 How about the subway ? 

7417. Probability: 0.9871

 OK . I'll take this one . 

7430. Probability: 0.9936
 Very well . We have some fresh red roses . 

7431. Probability: 0.9904
 That sounds like a good deal . 

7432. Probability: 0.9876
 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? 

7433. Probability: 0.9814
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 

7434. Probability: 0.9719
The dress looks beautiful . Can I touch it ? 

7435. Probability: 0.9719
 I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on . 

7436. Probability: 0.9728
 Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 

7437. Probability: 0.9772
 I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? 

7438. Probability: 0.9743
 I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . 

7439. Probability: 0.9993
 Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . 

7440. Probability: 0.9765
 Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . 

7441. Probability: 0.9772
 That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . 

7442. Probability: 0.9736
 I see . I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons . 

7443. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7444. Probability: 0.9952
 Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . 

7445. Probability: 0.9961
 He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it . 

7446. Probability: 0.9928
 I like that . 

7447. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

7448. Probability: 0.9827
 How about drinking soda ? 

7449. Probability: 0.9913
 Yes , I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it . 

7450. Probability: 0.9975
 I love the paint job ! 

7451. Probability: 0.9867
 What a beautiful home ! 

7452. Probability: 0.9711
 You ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new . 

7453. Probability: 0.9914
 I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street . 

7454. Probability: 0.9900
 Follow me into the kitchen . You will love it . 

7455. Probability: 0.9980
 I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen . 

7456. Probability: 0.9907
 The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom . 

7457. Probability: 0.9942
 I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering ! 

7458. Probability: 0.9910
 Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . 

7459. Probability: 0.9776
 I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops . 

7460. Probability: 0.9837
 That's very kind of you . Thank you.Er ... have you got a pencil ? 

7461. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7462. Probability: 0.9839
 That's good . 

7463. Probability: 0.9865
How about this floor lamp ? 

7464. Probability: 0.9914
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 

7465. Probability: 0.9883
 How about this floor lamp ? 

7466. Probability: 0.9914
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 

7467. Probability: 0.9929
 20 is very colorful and feels nice . I'd like to start with it . Is it pure silk ? 

7468. Probability: 0.9959
 Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things . 

7469. Probability: 0.9803
 It was my pleasure . 

7470. Probability: 0.9751
 It's my pleasure . How many copies would you want ? 

7471. Probability: 0.9977
 They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... 

7472. Probability: 0.9839
 Very well . 

7473. Probability: 0.9834
 I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . 

7474. Probability: 0.9801
 Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . 

7475. Probability: 0.9704
 Well , it has a cassette record ... a cassette tape . 

7476. Probability: 0.9845
 Oh , it's the first of April , April fool's day 

7477. Probability: 0.9765
 Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! 

7478. Probability: 0.9897
This is a very beautiful statue . What's it called ? 

7479. Probability: 0.9911
 It's called ' Endless Love ' . It was a gift from a sister city in Australia for the 100th anniversary of the city . 

7480. Probability: 0.9955
An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 

7481. Probability: 0.9800
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 

7482. Probability: 0.9818
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . 

7483. Probability: 0.9744
How about going swimming ? 

7484. Probability: 0.9703
 Yes . Maybe you should do it too . You may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know . 

7485. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7486. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , I see . 

7487. Probability: 0.9830
 really ? I didn't know that would be possible . 

7488. Probability: 0.9965
 I think that is really cool of you . 

7489. Probability: 0.9856
 You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . 

7490. Probability: 0.9792
 I saw it in this ad for apartments in today ’ s newspaper . 

7491. Probability: 0.9989
 Yes , it's quite amusing , actually . Good plot , and Sharon Stone's in it . 

7492. Probability: 0.9792
 Oh , she's good . She must be getting on a bit now . 

7493. Probability: 0.9841
 Yeah , but she looks amazing . 

7494. Probability: 0.9787
 Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat . 

7495. Probability: 0.9771
 Huh ? 

7496. Probability: 0.9840
 I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil . 

7497. Probability: 0.9841
 Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ? 

7498. Probability: 0.9960
 That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card . 

7499. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

7500. Probability: 0.9718
 I wonder if I can charge this call to my hotel room . 

7501. Probability: 0.9851
 It smells good . Look at these . They make my mouth watering . 

7502. Probability: 0.9841
 Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . ... wow ! You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV ! 

7503. Probability: 0.9814
 I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe ! 

7504. Probability: 0.9890
 I like that Kenmore refrigerator . 

7505. Probability: 0.9946
 This particular refrigerator is a very good choice . 

7506. Probability: 0.9870
 It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside . 

7507. Probability: 0.9743
 I like what I see . 

7508. Probability: 0.9709
 Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun . 

7509. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7510. Probability: 0.9711
 By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . 

7511. Probability: 0.9926
 I like that suggestion . Show me one , please . 

7512. Probability: 0.9766
 Here you go — Digital Barbie . 

7513. Probability: 0.9758
 Oh , my niece will love her ! How much for her ? 

7514. Probability: 0.9953
 That's great . I'll take her . 

7515. Probability: 0.9911
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 

7516. Probability: 0.9840
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 

7517. Probability: 0.9980
 Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 

7518. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

7519. Probability: 0.9877
 Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor . 

7520. Probability: 0.9777
 That's a good place to go at this time . How about this route ? 

7521. Probability: 0.9705
 You got me . 

7522. Probability: 0.9879
 I appreciate it . 

7523. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7524. Probability: 0.9911
 This morning , when we woke up , there was water pouring in from the ceiling ! 

7525. Probability: 0.9800
Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . 

7526. Probability: 0.9788
 Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . 

7527. Probability: 0.9706
 Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! 

7528. Probability: 0.9918
 Perfect . Thanks very much for calling . See you soon , bye ! 

7529. Probability: 0.9799
 I'd be very pleased . 

7530. Probability: 0.9876
This facility is great , don't you think ? 

7531. Probability: 0.9986
 Beautifully done . 

7532. Probability: 0.9757
 What about tomorrow morning , then ? 

7533. Probability: 0.9859
 How kind of you ! Good-bye . 

7534. Probability: 0.9734
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 

7535. Probability: 0.9888
 Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak . 

7536. Probability: 0.9738
 I'm glad you like it . It's $ 60 in all . 

7537. Probability: 0.9717
 Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams . 

7538. Probability: 0.9907
 Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it . 

7539. Probability: 0.9875
 I really envy you , Danny . 

7540. Probability: 0.9798
 Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? 

7541. Probability: 0.9957
 It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university . 

7542. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7543. Probability: 0.9804
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . 

7544. Probability: 0.9802
 I see . I'd like to live here for about three years . 

7545. Probability: 0.9947
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 

7546. Probability: 0.9778
 Well , how about fifty percent discount ? If so , I'll buy that fur coat . 

7547. Probability: 0.9966
 It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . 

7548. Probability: 0.9946
 We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . 

7549. Probability: 0.9889
 Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun . 

7550. Probability: 0.9768
 How about this set ? 

7551. Probability: 0.9890
 Looks nice . Okay , I'll take it . 

7552. Probability: 0.9813
 That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! 

7553. Probability: 0.9981
 Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! 

7554. Probability: 0.9923
 You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . 

7555. Probability: 0.9928
 Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . 

7556. Probability: 0.9864
 What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . 

7557. Probability: 0.9830
Say , how about having Chinese food for a change ? 

7558. Probability: 0.9992
 Great idea ! I like authentic Chinese food . 

7559. Probability: 0.9885
 Pork steamed with rice flour , jelly fish and egg soup . 

7560. Probability: 0.9726
 What about cigarettes or cigars ? 

7561. Probability: 0.9938
 I see . Well , consulting is a little different . 

7562. Probability: 0.9832
 Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants . 

7563. Probability: 0.9722
 Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? 

7564. Probability: 0.9791
 Yes , I've got that here ... 

7565. Probability: 0.9792
 You gave me a deep impression then . Can I help you ? 

7566. Probability: 0.9907
 Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . 

7567. Probability: 0.9914
 Oh , OK . Wow ! 

7568. Probability: 0.9973
 Wow . That sounds really good . 

7569. Probability: 0.9781
 Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . 

7570. Probability: 0.9943
 That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . 

7571. Probability: 0.9877
That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . 

7572. Probability: 0.9987
 Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well . 

7573. Probability: 0.9867
 Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you . 

7574. Probability: 0.9912
 Excellent . Have you had French food before ? 

7575. Probability: 0.9989
 Oh , yes . Marvelous ! 

7576. Probability: 0.9702
 We brought the price down only a few days ago . This is definitely a bargain . 

7577. Probability: 0.9841
 Perfect ! You'll be working alone on that portion . Do you like to work alone ? 

7578. Probability: 0.9805
 Fine . 

7579. Probability: 0.9782
 Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . 

7580. Probability: 0.9783
 I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! 

7581. Probability: 0.9703
 Why don't you sleep over ? 

7582. Probability: 0.9976
 Sounds like a good idea . 

7583. Probability: 0.9949
 How sweet ... if you make me some more toast , I'll let you use my new retro toaster ... 

7584. Probability: 0.9960
 Isn't the shape cool ? 

7585. Probability: 0.9867
 Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . 

7586. Probability: 0.9755
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . 

7587. Probability: 0.9790
 Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? 

7588. Probability: 0.9951
 Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number . 

7589. Probability: 0.9887
 Yes , we can arrange that . 

7590. Probability: 0.9945
 Excellent . 

7591. Probability: 0.9971
 That's not a bad idea . How much is it ? 

7592. Probability: 0.9904
 The chicken is also nice . 

7593. Probability: 0.9838
 Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb 

7594. Probability: 0.9794
 Really ? That's great . You really did a good job . Anything else to tell me ? 

7595. Probability: 0.9737
 Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back . 

7596. Probability: 0.9951
I really like the way this house looks . 

7597. Probability: 0.9962
 Yes , it has great curb appeal . 

7598. Probability: 0.9980
 The landscaping is wonderful ! 

7599. Probability: 0.9785
 Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior . 

7600. Probability: 0.9797
 Oh , I see what you mean ! 

7601. Probability: 0.9733
 The carpeting and paint are all new , as well as the window treatments . 

7602. Probability: 0.9969
 I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls . 

7603. Probability: 0.9950
 Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink ! 

7604. Probability: 0.9914
 I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom . 

7605. Probability: 0.9704
 Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . 

7606. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . Thank you . 

7607. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

7608. Probability: 0.9949
 That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? 

7609. Probability: 0.9982
 Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! 

7610. Probability: 0.9883
 I'll do with the cake . 

7611. Probability: 0.9784
 Good . Can I walk through this building ? 

7612. Probability: 0.9730
 How about Friday afternoon ? 

7613. Probability: 0.9951
 Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? 

7614. Probability: 0.9975
 I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . 

7615. Probability: 0.9770
 I wear size 32 . This one looks nice . Where may I try it on ? 

7616. Probability: 0.9798
 I'll take it . 

7617. Probability: 0.9880
 I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use . 

7618. Probability: 0.9893
 That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music . 

7619. Probability: 0.9845
 Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . 

7620. Probability: 0.9837
 Take a look at the newest Barbie — Digital Barbie . 

7621. Probability: 0.9903
 She's beautiful . What's the price for Digital Barbie ? 

7622. Probability: 0.9792
 Only $ 29.95 ? I'll buy it , of course . 

7623. Probability: 0.9775
 I'd like to put it on my VISA . 

7624. Probability: 0.9831
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 

7625. Probability: 0.9919
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . 

7626. Probability: 0.9879
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 

7627. Probability: 0.9873
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 

7628. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds good . 

7629. Probability: 0.9979
 It sounds amazing to me . 

7630. Probability: 0.9730
 Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas . 

7631. Probability: 0.9940
 Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible . 

7632. Probability: 0.9757
 I'm sure we will . Actually , we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder . 

7633. Probability: 0.9828
 I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . 

7634. Probability: 0.9876
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him . 

7635. Probability: 0.9753
 You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . 

7636. Probability: 0.9717
 I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... 

7637. Probability: 0.9884
 Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . 

7638. Probability: 0.9983
 Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport 

7639. Probability: 0.9717
 Great . Where is it ? 

7640. Probability: 0.9854
 Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then . 

7641. Probability: 0.9898
 Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 

7642. Probability: 0.9840
 Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . 

7643. Probability: 0.9821
 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 

7644. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

7645. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please .

 Why not ? It's the very reason why I've applied for this job . It's really exciting for me to experience business in an international environment . 

7654. Probability: 0.9857
 I appreciate that . 

7655. Probability: 0.9941
 We have a position where that could work out well . 

7656. Probability: 0.9767
 That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . 

7657. Probability: 0.9719
 It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson . 

7658. Probability: 0.9900
 that sounds good . 

7659. Probability: 0.9785
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? 

7660. Probability: 0.9797
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . 

7661. Probability: 0.9768
 Let ’ s rock n ’ roll . 

7662. Probability: 0.9758
 Let me see if I have that right . This contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . Is that right ? 

7663. Probability: 0.9761
 This food is a Wax specialty . Please help yourself .

 On the 14th Street side . Oh , we are already at the 16th Street . You are fast . Can you make a left at the next corner ?

 That's cool . 

7667. Probability: 0.9970
 Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . 

7668. Probability: 0.9857
 It's a light blue coat . It's got a hood and a big silver zipper . 

7669. Probability: 0.9829
 That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do . 

7670. Probability: 0.9727
 Let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer . 

7671. Probability: 0.9926
 Creativity , the ability to organize , the entrepreneur's spirit , comprehensive knowledge of human studies , ability of gathering information , expert competence of communication and deep professional skills . 

7672. Probability: 0.9830
Hey , Tom . I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 

7673. Probability: 0.9902
 It's for a job . It looks perfect for you . 

7674. Probability: 0.9767
 Thanks , Mary . You are real pal . I'll call now to set up an interview . 

7675. Probability: 0.9840
 I mean he's a student developing all round .

 In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style . 

7677. Probability: 0.9757
 A brand new taxi is pulling up now . 

7678. Probability: 0.9921
 That ’ s great .

 I really appreciate it . Thank you .

 Huh ?

 Right . That's good . 

7682. Probability: 0.9752
Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ? 

7683. Probability: 0.9917
 It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit . 

7684. Probability: 0.9741
 Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . 

7685. Probability: 0.9700
 Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ? 

7686. Probability: 0.9737
 That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat ! 

7687. Probability: 0.9872
 Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting . 

7688. Probability: 0.9854
 Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters . 

7689. Probability: 0.9770
Hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? 

7690. Probability: 0.9981
 Wonderful ! I think that's a great idea How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! 

7691. Probability: 0.9950
 Perfect . I'II start preparing tomorrow . If we re going to drive , l'II need to fill up the tank . 

7692. Probability: 0.9921
What a surprise we've met here ! 

7693. Probability: 0.9802
 That is good of you .

 Yes , it is . It's brilliant . 

7695. Probability: 0.9735
 Thank you . oh , can you get me some orange juice as well ?

 Yes . 

7697. Probability: 0.9802
 It's so nice of you . 

7698. Probability: 0.9950
 Yes . It's superb . 

7699. Probability: 0.9785
 Well , it's kind of you to say so . 

7700. Probability: 0.9806
 Yes , I've got it . 

7701. Probability: 0.9918
 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it . Show me what you ’ Ve done . Not bad . 

7702. Probability: 0.9776
I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ? 

7703. Probability: 0.9975
 Mmm , that sounds very interesting . 

7704. Probability: 0.9951
 Yes , we do . What a great taste you have ! But we only have one left in stock . 

7705. Probability: 0.9984
 Here it is . It's very elegant , I think you will like it . 

7706. Probability: 0.9720
 Yes , sir . It's the specialty of our restaurant . 

7707. Probability: 0.9976
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . 

7708. Probability: 0.9798
 Well , I want to extend it for 2 more nights . 

7709. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7710. Probability: 0.9728
 Let me see . Would it be all right on Wednesday morning ? 

7711. Probability: 0.9871
You'll love this . It's a chick drink . 

7712. Probability: 0.9901
 Well , that too . I mean that it's kind of sweet . See if you can guess what's in it . 

7713. Probability: 0.9907
 Mmm ! Beer , tequila , and ... lime ! 

7714. Probability: 0.9741
 Not bad . You really know your booze ... So I guess you know what's in the salsa , too ? 

7715. Probability: 0.9806
 The fruit basket was great . I need a few more apples , please . 

7716. Probability: 0.9804
 Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . 

7717. Probability: 0.9849
 It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one . 

7718. Probability: 0.9812
 There are so many to choose from . I didn't know you could do all of this using a card . 

7719. Probability: 0.9801
 Make them with French dressing . 

7720. Probability: 0.9718
 I'll do that then . 

7721. Probability: 0.9989
 Good idea ! The pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly . 

7722. Probability: 0.9707
 Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . 

7723. Probability: 0.9955
 Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . 

7724. Probability: 0.9961
 Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously . 

7725. Probability: 0.9796
 May I try it on ? 

7726. Probability: 0.9873
 Daddy , may I take your compass ? I feel so cool with it in my hand . 

7727. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

7728. Probability: 0.9953
 That would be fun . 

7729. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds good . 

7730. Probability: 0.9751
 Oh yeah . Here , I will just trade with him . 

7731. Probability: 0.9824
 But I ordered waffles ! 

7732. Probability: 0.9709
 That's OK . I will eat my eggs and bacon , and you can take my pancakes back . 

7733. Probability: 0.9764
 My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . 

7734. Probability: 0.9724
 How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? 

7735. Probability: 0.9994
 I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . 

7736. Probability: 0.9765
 No problem . This one is made of pure gold . 

7737. Probability: 0.9754
 I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful . 

7738. Probability: 0.9921
 You ’ re right . This one costs less , but is more beautiful . 

7739. Probability: 0.9736
 Ok . Can I try it on ? 

7740. Probability: 0.9814
 Cindy , you're so cute . 

7741. Probability: 0.9768
 Absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . 

7742. Probability: 0.9756
 Now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . 

7743. Probability: 0.9731
 We've got several kinds . All are made of different materials . 

7744. Probability: 0.9777
 Let me see . Well , I'd like onion soup . Thank you . 

7745. Probability: 0.9745
 OK , I would like to reserve the superior suite . Is breakfast included ? 

7746. Probability: 0.9821
 Here you are . You look younger in yellow . 

7747. Probability: 0.9744
 May I get an order of barbeque wings ? 

7748. Probability: 0.9704
 Oh , yes.Thank you . I'd be glad to . 

7749. Probability: 0.9931
 You're flattering me . 

7750. Probability: 0.9789
 I believe you are cut out for this position . You're an outstanding individual . 

7751. Probability: 0.9703
 Thanks , Sue . 

7752. Probability: 0.9971
 That's a good idea . Can you help me to get some ? 

7753. Probability: 0.9751
 A basket of lilies . 

7754. Probability: 0.9852
 Great ! Thank you very much . 

7755. Probability: 0.9937
 Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine . That's such a stylish way to travel . 

7756. Probability: 0.9871
 Look what you did to my rear bumper . 

7757. Probability: 0.9938
 That sounds delicious . 

7758. Probability: 0.9868
 May I try this on ? 

7759. Probability: 0.9726
 What about cigarettes or cigars ? 

7760. Probability: 0.9818
 Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me . 

7761. Probability: 0.9873
 It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . 

7762. Probability: 0.9933
 Sounds interesting . What about this ? 

7763. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

7764. Probability: 0.9896
 That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . 

7765. Probability: 0.9792
 Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? 

7766. Probability: 0.9715
 Yes . My eyes are small so I want to buy false eyelashes . 

7767. Probability: 0.9897
 That will make your eyes seem bigger . 

7768. Probability: 0.9735
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 

7769. Probability: 0.9992
 I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . 

7770. Probability: 0.9758
 You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . 

7771. Probability: 0.9945
 Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? 

7772. Probability: 0.9791
 There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . 

7773. Probability: 0.9965
 The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 

7774. Probability: 0.9882
 You know , that is one of my favorites ! 

7775. Probability: 0.9923
 Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 

7776. Probability: 0.9954
 I quite like this one.How much is it ? 

7777. Probability: 0.9958
 That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ? 

7778. Probability: 0.9771
 Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats . 

7779. Probability: 0.9879
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . 

7780. Probability: 0.9985
 Good idea . Let's ask the officer for help . 

7781. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7782. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

7783. Probability: 0.9971
 Really ? That ’ s so cool . 

7784. Probability: 0.9937
I ’ m glad you could make it . 

7785. Probability: 0.9826
 The wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table . 

7786. Probability: 0.9755
 You bet . I ’ ll swing by after lunch , okay ? 

7787. Probability: 0.9964
 That sounds like fun ! 

7788. Probability: 0.9700
 Oh really , what kind of fruit do you like ? 

7789. Probability: 0.9802
 Can we order a mixed drink in this restaurant ? 

7790. Probability: 0.9944
 That sounds like a good choice for me . May I have one , please ? 

7791. Probability: 0.9964
 Sounds persuasive . How much will you charge for it ? 

7792. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ? 

7793. Probability: 0.9747
 OK , I will take it . By the way , does the price include breakfast ? 

7794. Probability: 0.9799
 Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . 

7795. Probability: 0.9992
 That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ? 

7796. Probability: 0.9730
 No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . 

7797. Probability: 0.9852
 Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . 

7798. Probability: 0.9951
 Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? 

7799. Probability: 0.9985
 Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . 

7800. Probability: 0.9979
 Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? 

7801. Probability: 0.9832
 Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! 

7802. Probability: 0.9964
 Awesome ! 

7803. Probability: 0.9760
 Great . I'll take this brand . And how do I take these medicines ? 

7804. Probability: 0.9831
 OK , I see . Dear Daniel , please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this , your mother is waiting for you . If other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes , 1.4 meters , please ask him to go to the broadcasting station . Thank you ! 

7805. Probability: 0.9967
 Fantastic ! Is there a charge ? 

7806. Probability: 0.9846
 The apples were great . Could you bring a couple more up ? 

7807. Probability: 0.9772
 It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . 

7808. Probability: 0.9846
 How about traveler's insurance ? 

7809. Probability: 0.9707
 Yes , I can . 

7810. Probability: 0.9967
 Really ? that ’ s very good . What about French ? 

7811. Probability: 0.9737
 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 

7812. Probability: 0.9752
 Well , we could take the cable car . 

7813. Probability: 0.9943
 Ah ... let's just climb . It's more fun , I think . 

7814. Probability: 0.9830
 But we made it . 

7815. Probability: 0.9932
 This looks great . When was it built ? 

7816. Probability: 0.9951
 That's remarkable . 

7817. Probability: 0.9969
 Not a bad idea ! 

7818. Probability: 0.9846
 Well , let's see . I'd like to go to the Summer Palace . 

7819. Probability: 0.9997
Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit ? It's a clever design . 

7820. Probability: 0.9771
 I'm doing it for fun and fitness . 

7821. Probability: 0.9732
 Currencies . 

7822. Probability: 0.9751
 Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ 

7823. Probability: 0.9939
 Fine . Shanghai and Beijing are thousands of miles away . How about bullet train ? Faster and relatively cheap , I think . 

7824. Probability: 0.9991
 Brilliant idea ! That will make our journey rewarding and much safer . 

7825. Probability: 0.9862
 Sounds pretty good . I see the equalizer has a good selection of settings . 

7826. Probability: 0.9893
 Of course , I designed a more powerful gasoline engine , which greatly increased the speed of limousines . 

7827. Probability: 0.9720
 Certainly , madam . The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area , which is only l . 4 meter in depth . We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge . 

7828. Probability: 0.9980
 That's great ! Can you give me the key to the locker ? I can't wait to have a try . 

7829. Probability: 0.9786
 How about rose ? It's the most suitable one for lovers . 

7830. Probability: 0.9912
 Well , what about violet ? It means the eternal beauty . 

7831. Probability: 0.9987
 It looks good . Pack me a bouquet of violet , please . 

7832. Probability: 0.9834
 Pretty good.Thank you . 

7833. Probability: 0.9758
 It's my pleasure . 

7834. Probability: 0.9725
 Yes , and for the first time . 

7835. Probability: 0.9875
 Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . 

7836. Probability: 0.9829
 That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . 

7837. Probability: 0.9826
 Yes , please . I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother . He's going to take a trip to South America . 

7838. Probability: 0.9844
 How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather . 

7839. Probability: 0.9922
 My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual . 

7840. Probability: 0.9805
 This gift is the best for a man who has everything . 

7841. Probability: 0.9992
 Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it . 

7842. Probability: 0.9774
 You can ask the guests to help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . 

7843. Probability: 0.9854
Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ? 

7844. Probability: 0.9725
 How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ? 

7845. Probability: 0.9761
 Right . Cool ! Let's go ! 

7846. Probability: 0.9745
Hello , madam . Would you like to take a look at our products ? They are high-tech items . 

7847. Probability: 0.9985
 Hmm , they look interesting . Can I have a copy of your brochure ? 

7848. Probability: 0.9870
 You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella . 

7849. Probability: 0.9935
 How amazing ! I have never seen it before . Is it expensive ? 

7850. Probability: 0.9959
 That sounds really good . 

7851. Probability: 0.9767
 Fine , I'll make it . 

7852. Probability: 0.9859
 I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . 

7853. Probability: 0.9898
 Oh , my God . It ’ s beautiful . But it looks expensive . 

7854. Probability: 0.9770
 What about this one ? It sells like hot cakes . 

7855. Probability: 0.9842
 Mix a little soya sauce , vinegar and sliced ginger on this plate and dip the meat in it before eating . 

7856. Probability: 0.9986
 That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . 

7857. Probability: 0.9787
 you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! 

7858. Probability: 0.9964
 very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 

7859. Probability: 0.9953
 that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . 

7860. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7861. Probability: 0.9951
 Thank you . It looks very attractive . 

7862. Probability: 0.9748
 You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . 

7863. Probability: 0.9834
Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . 

7864. Probability: 0.9851
 Maybe . Oh . I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it.It was very exciting . 

7865. Probability: 0.9980
 Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . 

7866. Probability: 0.9946
 Good , you can make your dream come true here . 

7867. Probability: 0.9739
 Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . 

7868. Probability: 0.9801
 Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? 

7869. Probability: 0.9837
Hey , look out ! 

7870. Probability: 0.9712
 This is the right bus . 

7871. Probability: 0.9732
 That would be perfect . 

7872. Probability: 0.9909
 It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 

7873. Probability: 0.9801
 Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? 

7874. Probability: 0.9988
 Good idea . How about a cup of coffee ? 

7875. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

7876. Probability: 0.9770
 Yes , we have a hatch with a ladder . 

7877. Probability: 0.9829
 That's great . Thank you very much .

 You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability . 

7879. Probability: 0.9796
 Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . 

7880. Probability: 0.9745
 Ok , shall I make a coffee first ? 

7881. Probability: 0.9907
 That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight . 

7882. Probability: 0.9809
 Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks . 

7883. Probability: 0.9922
 Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em . 

7884. Probability: 0.9991
 That's funny . My watch always loses ten minutes a day . 

7885. Probability: 0.9880
 No kidding . 

7886. Probability: 0.9752
 You know what you can do ? 

7887. Probability: 0.9980
 What an agile child ! 

7888. Probability: 0.9976
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . 

7889. Probability: 0.9933
 Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience . 

7890. Probability: 0.9702
 This dress is the latest fashion form Paris . It ’ s made of pure silk . And this silk blouse would go with this skirt . Do you like it ? 

7891. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7892. Probability: 0.9985
 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll try it on . 

7893. Probability: 0.9731
 It feels very good . 

7894. Probability: 0.9736
 You look wonderful . 

7895. Probability: 0.9813
I see an Open House sign over there , and I think we should go check it out . 

7896. Probability: 0.9915
 I love the beautiful lawn . What a great front entryway ! 

7897. Probability: 0.9902
 That works for me . We can check out the kitchen next . 

7898. Probability: 0.9936
 On such a hot day , it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers . 

7899. Probability: 0.9742
 Check out the flyer with all of the home ’ s information on it . 

7900. Probability: 0.9831
 Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . 

7901. Probability: 0.9881
 You are so thoughtful . Do you think our tent will be working well ? 

7902. Probability: 0.9781
 Good . We should tell our neighbour that they can call the police if some emergency happens to us . 

7903. Probability: 0.9729
 Yes . You think a lot , too . 

7904. Probability: 0.9879
 In that case , what about having some noodles ? 

7905. Probability: 0.9987
 That's great . I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests ? 

7906. Probability: 0.9810
 I see . Why not use wooden cases ? 

7907. Probability: 0.9902
 Sounds good . 

7908. Probability: 0.9734
 We have developed new technology about it . And the new product will be a pleasure to be hold . 

7909. Probability: 0.9856
 Well , it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that . 

7910. Probability: 0.9716
 Oh , yes , I would ! 

7911. Probability: 0.9771
 Okay , I'll take it . Could you help me gift wrap it ? 

7912. Probability: 0.9897
 I think so . The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA . He is good at making cookies . 

7913. Probability: 0.9798
 Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now . 

7914. Probability: 0.9867
 Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one . 

7915. Probability: 0.9751
 You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter . 

7916. Probability: 0.9917
 I am starting loving this bakery now . 

7917. Probability: 0.9823
 I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . 

7918. Probability: 0.9879
 Yes , that's great . Thanks . 

7919. Probability: 0.9945
 Sure , we have both skirts and slacks that will go well with the sweater . I especially like this flowery skirt . It's very much in style this year . 

7920. Probability: 0.9824
 Oh , yes . Just show me where the fitting rooms are now . I can't wait to try this on . 

7921. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

7922. Probability: 0.9916
 Really ? That's good news for me . 

7923. Probability: 0.9969
 It sounds great ! 

7924. Probability: 0.9710
 We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down . 

7925. Probability: 0.9879
 high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . 

7926. Probability: 0.9824
 It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . 

7927. Probability: 0.9932
 It's a bit small but looks nice . 

7928. Probability: 0.9815
 What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . 

7929. Probability: 0.9827
 Wow , I can't thank you enough . 

7930. Probability: 0.9718
 I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . 

7931. Probability: 0.9927
 Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . 

7932. Probability: 0.9780
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 

7933. Probability: 0.9854
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . 

7934. Probability: 0.9827
 How about drinking soda ? 

7935. Probability: 0.9984
 Yes , that looks great ! Is it on our Open House list ? 

7936. Probability: 0.9722
 OK , let ’ s go check out the kitchen next . 

7937. Probability: 0.9779
 Well , let's get a plate of those then . 

7938. Probability: 0.9884
 Sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? 

7939. Probability: 0.9869
 I think I might have a dahl . 

7940. Probability: 0.9855
 It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . 

7941. Probability: 0.9935
 That sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? 

7942. Probability: 0.9767
 Ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? 

7943. Probability: 0.9904
 That's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? 

7944. Probability: 0.9776
 Ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? 

7945. Probability: 0.9747
 I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The burse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us 

7946. Probability: 0.9822
 Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum . 

7947. Probability: 0.9965
 Oh , yes , this is much better . But it has an aluminum handle . 

7948. Probability: 0.9929
 Yes , that's perfect . I'll take it . 

7949. Probability: 0.9756
 Great . Will that be cash or charge ? 

7950. Probability: 0.9827
 Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? 

7951. Probability: 0.9802
 They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . 

7952. Probability: 0.9927
 Yes , we are match made in heaven . 

7953. Probability: 0.9773
 Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too . We countered the problems , and had a lot of happiness too . 

7954. Probability: 0.9768
You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 

7955. Probability: 0.9711
 How about a cup of coffee ? 

7956. Probability: 0.9748
 I have done something like that before . 

7957. Probability: 0.9815
I would love to rent this apartment . 

7958. Probability: 0.9774
I cooked , so ... 

7959. Probability: 0.9866
 Use this one . 

7960. Probability: 0.9722
 OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . 

7961. Probability: 0.9844
 Well , the express one , with air-conditioning . 

7962. Probability: 0.9889
 That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . 

7963. Probability: 0.9943
 That sounds like a great salad . 

7964. Probability: 0.9868
 Why don't you put it in your salad ? 

7965. Probability: 0.9977
 That sounds like a plan to me . 

7966. Probability: 0.9808
 What if I buy around ticket ? Can you offer me some more ? 

7967. Probability: 0.9962
 That's great ! I will take the next train . 

7968. Probability: 0.9718
 She'll be very happy with this . And how do you plan to pay for it ? 

7969. Probability: 0.9776
 It's my pleasure ! 

7970. Probability: 0.9882
 How about my hand carry luggage ? 

7971. Probability: 0.9949
Jack ! You've really done it this time . 

7972. Probability: 0.9906
 I should say it is something we have never come across before . 

7973. Probability: 0.9929
 Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . 

7974. Probability: 0.9734
 I'm waiting . Your early offer will be highly appreciated . 

7975. Probability: 0.9919
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 

7976. Probability: 0.9743
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 

7977. Probability: 0.9824
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 

7978. Probability: 0.9978
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 

7979. Probability: 0.9871
 I appreciate it . It is related to company image . 

7980. Probability: 0.9936
 Well , it all looks so good . How about ordering the steamed prawns ? 

7981. Probability: 0.9925
 Thank you . The change , sir . 

7982. Probability: 0.9875
 Great . Thank you . 

7983. Probability: 0.9775
Excuse me . Can I get a refund of my ticket ? I have to cancel my trip because I have something emergent to deal with . 

7984. Probability: 0.9760
 Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? 

7985. Probability: 0.9820
 You are smart . The city is really charming at night . 

7986. Probability: 0.9946
 Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? 

7987. Probability: 0.9743
 Yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? 

7988. Probability: 0.9970
 No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . 

7989. Probability: 0.9870
 How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ? 

7990. Probability: 0.9993
 That ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 

7991. Probability: 0.9965
 The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? 

7992. Probability: 0.9848
 That ’ s even better than the real thing . 

7993. Probability: 0.9921
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? 

7994. Probability: 0.9741
 Oh , there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon . I have two tickets . Would you like to go there with me ? 

7995. Probability: 0.9866
 That's very impressive . Which course did you like best ? 

7996. Probability: 0.9899
 English . It was both interesting and useful , so I showed a great interest in it . 

7997. Probability: 0.9823
 That sounds fine . 

7998. Probability: 0.9885
 Why not tell the clerk and ask them to repair it . 

7999. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

8000. Probability: 0.9903
 Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings . 

8001. Probability: 0.9795
 Yes . I want to reserve a table for two this evening . 

8002. Probability: 0.9860
 That's a switch . 

8003. Probability: 0.9935
Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? 

8004. Probability: 0.9817
 Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . 

8005. Probability: 0.9886
 You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . 

8006. Probability: 0.9961
 An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . 

8007. Probability: 0.9761
 Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? 

8008. Probability: 0.9906
 I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . 

8009. Probability: 0.9771
 So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? 

8010. Probability: 0.9707
Excuse me , I'd like to try some Chinese food . 

8011. Probability: 0.9785
 How about Sichuan food ? 

8012. Probability: 0.9949
 I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious . We have a Sichuan food dining room . May I suggest you to go there ? It's on the third floor . 

8013. Probability: 0.9758
 It's my pleasure . 

8014. Probability: 0.9716
 Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station . 

8015. Probability: 0.9701
 Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then . 

8016. Probability: 0.9764
 Yes . I'll have the fresh fruit cocktail . 

8017. Probability: 0.9981
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 

8018. Probability: 0.9827
 You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat ! 

8019. Probability: 0.9951
 Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections they have ? 

8020. Probability: 0.9814
 Private collectors ! Oh , they must have excellent collections . I'll go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , David , don't keep me in suspense ! 

8021. Probability: 0.9751
 No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars . 

8022. Probability: 0.9932
 Very interesting . That's really a place I must go and see . And then ? 

8023. Probability: 0.9828
 Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say . 

8024. Probability: 0.9777
 Think of something . 

8025. Probability: 0.9845
 How about I get pizza and you get a burger ? 

8026. Probability: 0.9723
 Let's do that then . 

8027. Probability: 0.9829
 Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . 

8028. Probability: 0.9701
 Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . 

8029. Probability: 0.9770
 No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . 

8030. Probability: 0.9881
 Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . 

8031. Probability: 0.9905
 I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? 

8032. Probability: 0.9775
 Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ? 

8033. Probability: 0.9827
 That sounds good . Last year I paid $ 30 . 

8034. Probability: 0.9846
 She should be very pleased with these roses . 

8035. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8036. Probability: 0.9924
 Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? 

8037. Probability: 0.9867
 You never know when two might turn into three . 

8038. Probability: 0.9942
 Now that's a plus ! 

8039. Probability: 0.9973
 That's fantastic . I think I like this one . 

8040. Probability: 0.9868
 A good choice . I prefer that one myself . 

8041. Probability: 0.9819
 I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up . 

8042. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8043. Probability: 0.9702
 Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . 

8044. Probability: 0.9839
 Very well . 

8045. Probability: 0.9876
 How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? 

8046. Probability: 0.9749
 Twice cooked spicy pork slices . 

8047. Probability: 0.9774
 OK . Let me try it . 

8048. Probability: 0.9718
 Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here . Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ? 

8049. Probability: 0.9951
 That's great . I'll wait . See you next weekend . 

8050. Probability: 0.9790
 Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? 

8051. Probability: 0.9951
 Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number . 

8052. Probability: 0.9801
 Great ! How much is it for a copy ? 

8053. Probability: 0.9945
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ? 

8054. Probability: 0.9981
 That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . 

8055. Probability: 0.9753
 Let's take the MET . lt's faster and cheap . 

8056. Probability: 0.9714
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back at about 7 p . m . 

8057. Probability: 0.9731
 Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ? 

8058. Probability: 0.9742
 It is so nice of you . 

8059. Probability: 0.9767
 That ’ s great to hear . 

8060. Probability: 0.9858
 Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . 

8061. Probability: 0.9717
May I try on this pair of shoes ? 

8062. Probability: 0.9876
 Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? 

8063. Probability: 0.9869
 This is just right for me . I'll take this one . 

8064. Probability: 0.9792
 Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . 

8065. Probability: 0.9778
 Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks . 

8066. Probability: 0.9987
 What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny ! 

8067. Probability: 0.9730
 Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . 

8068. Probability: 0.9713
 Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . 

8069. Probability: 0.9829
 Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! 

8070. Probability: 0.9759
 Look ! The iron is still on . 

8071. Probability: 0.9812
 553-2213 . Great , thanks . 

8072. Probability: 0.9897
 Great ! Thanks a lot ! 

8073. Probability: 0.9802
 ( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh , excuse me , where is the Lost and Found ? 

8074. Probability: 0.9737
 Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 

8075. Probability: 0.9829
 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 

8076. Probability: 0.9822
 Medium , I think . 

8077. Probability: 0.9945
 It's pretty . Can I try it on ? 

8078. Probability: 0.9734
 Oh , did they ? Well , would you give us an extra key to the room ? 

8079. Probability: 0.9732
 You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . 

8080. Probability: 0.9784
 It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . 

8081. Probability: 0.9857
 He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . 

8082. Probability: 0.9790
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . 

8083. Probability: 0.9977
 That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 

8084. Probability: 0.9792
 That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 

8085. Probability: 0.9951
 Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks . 

8086. Probability: 0.9715
 I appreciate it . Thank you . 

8087. Probability: 0.9938
 that's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 

8088. Probability: 0.9957
 good idea . That will help us to warm up . 

8089. Probability: 0.9855
 Very good . How much does each copy cost ? 

8090. Probability: 0.9734
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 

8091. Probability: 0.9837
 ( After trying ) Mm , a perfect fit . How much ? 

8092. Probability: 0.9924
 Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . 

8093. Probability: 0.9913
 How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? 

8094. Probability: 0.9907
 That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood . 

8095. Probability: 0.9818
How beautiful the flower is ! 

8096. Probability: 0.9961
 Really , it's so beautiful . 

8097. Probability: 0.9816
 It's a private garden . 

8098. Probability: 0.9734
 We have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana . 

8099. Probability: 0.9901
 Very well , I'll try the banana flavor . 

8100. Probability: 0.9814
 You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . 

8101. Probability: 0.9709
 Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ? 

8102. Probability: 0.9826
 Yes , I would love to work on a special project ! 

8103. Probability: 0.9973
 I love that kind of stuff . 

8104. Probability: 0.9939
 Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk . 

8105. Probability: 0.9875
 Just joking , T . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . 

8106. Probability: 0.9703
 That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ? 

8107. Probability: 0.9867
 Let's drive off this road . 

8108. Probability: 0.9758
 It's my pleasure . 

8109. Probability: 0.9741
 Yes , Anthony Fox . 

8110. Probability: 0.9885
 Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ? 

8111. Probability: 0.9803
 yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just 

8112. Probability: 0.9819
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . 

8113. Probability: 0.9838
 That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? 

8114. Probability: 0.9753
 No problem . How about 10 ' o clock this Sunday morning ? 

8115. Probability: 0.9802
 Very well , thank you . 

8116. Probability: 0.9836
 Wow ! You're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . 

8117. Probability: 0.9855
 Bottoms up ! 

8118. Probability: 0.9898
 How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here . 

8119. Probability: 0.9895
 Sounds good . I'll take that . 

8120. Probability: 0.9843
 A fried crisp chicken and an eggplant with chili sauce . 

8121. Probability: 0.9821
 How about drink ? 

8122. Probability: 0.9714
 Yes , I wanna buy a skirt . 

8123. Probability: 0.9977
 It's very good , and it's fresh too . 

8124. Probability: 0.9890
 The food there is a great step up from Sons . 

8125. Probability: 0.9874
 OK . I'd like to book a ticket for this one . 

8126. Probability: 0.9707
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 

8127. Probability: 0.9992
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 

8128. Probability: 0.9972
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 

8129. Probability: 0.9731
 Good . Let's go now . 

8130. Probability: 0.9947
wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ? 

8131. Probability: 0.9933
 I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife . 

8132. Probability: 0.9944
 incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ? 

8133. Probability: 0.9915
 oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one . 

8134. Probability: 0.9913
 oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? 

8135. Probability: 0.9801
 certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique 

8136. Probability: 0.9770
 it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . 

8137. Probability: 0.9961
 Really ? Great ! 

8138. Probability: 0.9869
 Okay . I guess I could give it a try . 

8139. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8140. Probability: 0.9966
 Sounds like fun . 

8141. Probability: 0.9756
Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? 

8142. Probability: 0.9919
 That's great ! 

8143. Probability: 0.9749
 How fresh is that apple pie over there ? 

8144. Probability: 0.9815
 Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then . 

8145. Probability: 0.9852
 That sounds good . Well , do you give discount for a week or more ? 

8146. Probability: 0.9729
 All right . I will take a room for a week . 

8147. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds good . 

8148. Probability: 0.9948
 What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ... 

8149. Probability: 0.9789
 You and your fancy Italian names . 

8150. Probability: 0.9758
 It's my pleasure . 

8151. Probability: 0.9809
 You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit . 

8152. Probability: 0.9880
Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . 

8153. Probability: 0.9787
 Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . 

8154. Probability: 0.9804
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . 

8155. Probability: 0.9802
 I see . I'd like to live here for about three years . 

8156. Probability: 0.9947
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 

8157. Probability: 0.9926
 I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . 

8158. Probability: 0.9928
 Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? 

8159. Probability: 0.9840
 No , it's just perfect . 

8160. Probability: 0.9790
 No , really , it feels great . 

8161. Probability: 0.9939
 That ’ s lovely . 

8162. Probability: 0.9758
 Then , perhaps a leather belt would work . Come here . Let me show you some . 

8163. Probability: 0.9885
 It is really like a labyrinth . 

8164. Probability: 0.9793
Taxi ! Taxi ! 

8165. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

8166. Probability: 0.9984
I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . 

8167. Probability: 0.9977
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . 

8168. Probability: 0.9871
 I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . 

8169. Probability: 0.9752
 Of course . I made apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . 

8170. Probability: 0.9930
 I love you home made apple pie . It ’ s delicious . Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? 

8171. Probability: 0.9858
 Yes , and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the interview . 

8172. Probability: 0.9750
 Thanks , Dan . 

8173. Probability: 0.9834
 I ’ m going to paint it . 

8174. Probability: 0.9864
 I ’ m going to paint it pink . 

8175. Probability: 0.9849
 Pink ! 

8176. Probability: 0.9767
 This bookcase isn ’ t for me . It ’ s for my daughter , Susan . Pink ’ s her favorite colour . 

8177. Probability: 0.9734
 Well , why don't you ask Bob for some money ? I'm hungry too . 

8178. Probability: 0.9800
 How do you want your hair cut ? Any particular way ? 

8179. Probability: 0.9705
 Of course . But I suggest you buy a lipgloss . The shining effect is in . 

8180. Probability: 0.9873
 You did a wonderful job . 

8181. Probability: 0.9798
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 

8182. Probability: 0.9863
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 

8183. Probability: 0.9902
 Www ! 

8184. Probability: 0.9798
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! 

8185. Probability: 0.9913
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! 

8186. Probability: 0.9990
 Great play ! 

8187. Probability: 0.9855
 These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? 

8188. Probability: 0.9739
 How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . 

8189. Probability: 0.9860
 That ’ s crazy ! 

8190. Probability: 0.9796
 Very good , sir . Will you register , please ? 

8191. Probability: 0.9760
 You are excellent . 

8192. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8193. Probability: 0.9898
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . 

8194. Probability: 0.9830
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . 

8195. Probability: 0.9714
 Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? 

8196. Probability: 0.9786
I am so excited ! 

8197. Probability: 0.9716
 That ’ s lucky . 

8198. Probability: 0.9864
 No , but that makes me even more excited . 

8199. Probability: 0.9821
 Yes ! 

8200. Probability: 0.9829
Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for ! 

8201. Probability: 0.9978
 You have good taste . It's made of red wood . 

8202. Probability: 0.9838
 Believe me , it's worth the price . 

8203. Probability: 0.9710
 First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . 

8204. Probability: 0.9916
Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? 

8205. Probability: 0.9758
 Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too . 

8206. Probability: 0.9866
 Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? 

8207. Probability: 0.9818
 It'll really take me to the station ? 

8208. Probability: 0.9907
 It goes all the way there . 

8209. Probability: 0.9894
 OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives . 

8210. Probability: 0.9980
 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . 

8211. Probability: 0.9901
Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you . 

8212. Probability: 0.9949
 Well , that necklace isn't bad . 

8213. Probability: 0.9743
 How about taxes service charge ? 

8214. Probability: 0.9795
 Very well . Thank you . 

8215. Probability: 0.9882
 yes , it is so . i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time . it is fun and exciting . 

8216. Probability: 0.9974
 of course.it is really fantastic too , and it makes me eager to dance . 

8217. Probability: 0.9948
 it is full of energy . 

8218. Probability: 0.9939
 this song is really worthy listening to and enjoying . 

8219. Probability: 0.9715
 well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . 

8220. Probability: 0.9811
 yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . 

8221. Probability: 0.9912
 they look delicious . I think she'll be pleased . 

8222. Probability: 0.9767
 I agreed , Hi , guess what ? I went bungee jumping last weekend . 

8223. Probability: 0.9974
 No , really , I think you'd like it . I adapted to it right off the bat . 

8224. Probability: 0.9759
 Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! 

8225. Probability: 0.9789
 Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! 

8226. Probability: 0.9871
 Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! 

8227. Probability: 0.9987
 It's a good idea . 

8228. Probability: 0.9882
 What about cheese cake or apple pie ? 

8229. Probability: 0.9761
 Maybe I want an apple pie . 

8230. Probability: 0.9928
 Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . 

8231. Probability: 0.9974
 Oh , yes . The green dress is very smart . but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat . 

8232. Probability: 0.9721
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 

8233. Probability: 0.9712
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 

8234. Probability: 0.9721
 What does a mango taste like ? 

8235. Probability: 0.9883
 Oh , yes ! 

8236. Probability: 0.9941
 I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting . 

8237. Probability: 0.9977
 Thank you . That's a good idea . she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ? 

8238. Probability: 0.9722
 Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! 

8239. Probability: 0.9722
 OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . 

8240. Probability: 0.9959
 Really ? Why not ? 

8241. Probability: 0.9818
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 

8242. Probability: 0.9984
 That's a good idea ! 

8243. Probability: 0.9852
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 

8244. Probability: 0.9937
 Goodness me ! What a choice ! I think I ’ ll have a cappuccino please . 

8245. Probability: 0.9945
 Son , it looks great on you . 

8246. Probability: 0.9735
 Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . 

8247. Probability: 0.9705
 Gee ! You are really strong-willed . 

8248. Probability: 0.9936
 Certainly . It could really benefit someone like you . Besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company . 

8249. Probability: 0.9928
 That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! 

8250. Probability: 0.9810
 OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . 

8251. Probability: 0.9826
 So how about an aperitif ? 

8252. Probability: 0.9734
 It sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . 

8253. Probability: 0.9866
 Try a Stinger . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice . 

8254. Probability: 0.9948
 It sounds interesting . I'll take one . 

8255. Probability: 0.9716
 How about we go and get something to drink ? 

8256. Probability: 0.9751
 Let's do that . 

8257. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds good . 

8258. Probability: 0.9855
 It's a lot better than soda . 

8259. Probability: 0.9980
 Good idea . 

8260. Probability: 0.9821
 Yes ! 

8261. Probability: 0.9702
 That's a good point . I'll make a note to increase it to 4.80 to make sure we can accept the new containers . 

8262. Probability: 0.9859
 I think you'd be perfect for this job . This company needs someone like you . When can you start working ? 

8263. Probability: 0.9721
 How about this one ? 

8264. Probability: 0.9828
 Can I try it on and see how it looks ? 

8265. Probability: 0.9947
 Looks good . I'll take it . 

8266. Probability: 0.9846
 Good . Go on , please . 

8267. Probability: 0.9700
 Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . 

8268. Probability: 0.9765
 My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? 

8269. Probability: 0.9750
 I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ? 

8270. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8271. Probability: 0.9948
 Rise and shine . 

8272. Probability: 0.9866
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . 

8273. Probability: 0.9923
 Yes , everything has been well designed . 

8274. Probability: 0.9800
 Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . 

8275. Probability: 0.9843
 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? 

8276. Probability: 0.9950
 That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . 

8277. Probability: 0.9959
 Adaptability and sense of humor . 

8278. Probability: 0.9705
 Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . 

8279. Probability: 0.9701
 Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 

8280. Probability: 0.9898
 Great . I ’ ll have a shot . 

8281. Probability: 0.9736
 All right . I will take a room for a week . Here is my passport . 

8282. Probability: 0.9718
 I've done it for you . 

8283. Probability: 0.9975
 That sounds like fun . Let's do it . 

8284. Probability: 0.9971
 Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we 

8285. Probability: 0.9931
 Why don't you change the cash to traveler's checks ? It's much more convenient and safer . When you are abroad , you can cash them . 

8286. Probability: 0.9961
 Well , that's great . 

8287. Probability: 0.9922
 Yes , something just opened up . 

8288. Probability: 0.9721
 How about this one ? 

8289. Probability: 0.9799
 Well , I'll take five of the seventy cent ones , and those grapefruits sweet ? 

8290. Probability: 0.9871
 Sure ! They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece . 

8291. Probability: 0.9721
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 

8292. Probability: 0.9712
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 

8293. Probability: 0.9721
 What does a mango taste like ? 

8294. Probability: 0.9825
 Wow , thanks a lot . 

8295. Probability: 0.9740
 Yes , I see . 

8296. Probability: 0.9738
 Yes , very . 

8297. Probability: 0.9776
 It's very nice of you . 

8298. Probability: 0.9726
 Yes , I ’ d like to do that . 

8299. Probability: 0.9824
 Very good , you can come here to work next month . 

8300. Probability: 0.9744
 We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . 

8301. Probability: 0.9791
 Yeah ! 

8302. Probability: 0.9931
 Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool . 

8303. Probability: 0.9822
 Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts . 

8304. Probability: 0.9790
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . 

8305. Probability: 0.9977
 That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 

8306. Probability: 0.9792
 That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 

8307. Probability: 0.9935
 No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . 

8308. Probability: 0.9919
 Sounds fun.Anyone I know ? 

8309. Probability: 0.9703
 Sure , that would be a good place for them . 

8310. Probability: 0.9793
 That would be great . What is the blood test for ? 

8311. Probability: 0.9755
 Yes , that's right.But I'm having a holiday here . 

8312. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8313. Probability: 0.9726
 It's pretty , isn't it ? It's made of pure silk and it's on sale . 

8314. Probability: 0.9815
 OK . I'll take it . Will you gift-wrap this , please ? 

8315. Probability: 0.9808
 Maybe we should call its after-service man . 

8316. Probability: 0.9798
Mom , am I like a superman ? All I need is a cape . 

8317. Probability: 0.9701
 Sure ! 

8318. Probability: 0.9841
 He says he's just arrived in Scotland . He says he's staying at a Youth Hostel . You know he's a member of the Y . H . A . 

8319. Probability: 0.9862
 This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you . 

8320. Probability: 0.9755
 Yes , I'd like to have this parcel delivered to Shanghai . 

8321. Probability: 0.9701
 Oh , you are such a good child today . Come here . Sit next to me . 

8322. Probability: 0.9941
 Great . That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake . 

8323. Probability: 0.9856
 In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding . 

8324. Probability: 0.9903
 Well , why not ? 

8325. Probability: 0.9853
 Good , let's go for a drive . 

8326. Probability: 0.9720
 Okay , I'll get the car out of the garage . 

8327. Probability: 0.9934
 Great . 

8328. Probability: 0.9840
 The dry red wine looks quite good . I'd like to try this one . 

8329. Probability: 0.9962
 That's really nice . I'd like this one . It looks very attractive . 

8330. Probability: 0.9868
 Sure . We'd like to have Black Forest Cake for dessert . 

8331. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8332. Probability: 0.9870
 Yes . Quite good . Perhaps you're very interested in the social benefits . 

8333. Probability: 0.9740
 Yes , I see . 

8334. Probability: 0.9873
 Certainly . How about spaghetti with clams and shrimps . 

8335. Probability: 0.9931
 Sounds delicious . OK . She'll try that . 

8336. Probability: 0.9843
 My pleasure . 

8337. Probability: 0.9991
 So , I can choose exactly what services I require ? That's brilliant . Can I use the card if I'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ? 

8338. Probability: 0.9918
 This is just what I've been looking for . Sign me up right away , please . 

8339. Probability: 0.9988
I like the design of the coat . 

8340. Probability: 0.9918
 But I like its color . 

8341. Probability: 0.9738
 Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . 

8342. Probability: 0.9814
 Cindy , you're so cute . 

8343. Probability: 0.9726
 absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . 

8344. Probability: 0.9981
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 

8345. Probability: 0.9749
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 

8346. Probability: 0.9714
 Oh , it is nice and cold , definitely good orange juice . 

8347. Probability: 0.9805
 How about a movie ? 

8348. Probability: 0.9711
 A movie sounds good . 

8349. Probability: 0.9837
 Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . 

8350. Probability: 0.9944
 I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? 

8351. Probability: 0.9980
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . 

8352. Probability: 0.9740
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . 

8353. Probability: 0.9780
 I ’ m really looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! 

8354. Probability: 0.9712
 But there are cartoons on TV . Bees , big trees , seas , and a lot of other interesting things . 

8355. Probability: 0.9848
 Sweet and sour pro chops , Madam . 

8356. Probability: 0.9827
 You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat ! 

8357. Probability: 0.9883
 That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it . 

8358. Probability: 0.9861
 Great . See you then . 

8359. Probability: 0.9820
 That sounds good . I think I'll have the same . 

8360. Probability: 0.9834
 OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get s 

8361. Probability: 0.9980
 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . 

8362. Probability: 0.9738
 Yes , Mr.Forester . 

8363. Probability: 0.9883
 I'll do with the cake . 

8364. Probability: 0.9852
 I like the kinds of instruments that they use . 

8365. Probability: 0.9888
 I think that's an excellent reason to like something . 

8366. Probability: 0.9865
 Yes , we have landscape paintings , figure paintings and flower-and-bird paintings . 

8367. Probability: 0.9979
 Good . How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . 

8368. Probability: 0.9979
 Oh , they look just like live cranes . I like this picture very much . How much is it ? 

8369. Probability: 0.9965
 It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it . 

8370. Probability: 0.9983
 I ’ m doing it ! I ’ m driving ! This is awesome ! Let ’ s turn some music on ! 

8371. Probability: 0.9842
 that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . 

8372. Probability: 0.9772
 why not ? 

8373. Probability: 0.9739
 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . 

8374. Probability: 0.9894
 The figure seems right . 

8375. Probability: 0.9968
Isn't this fun ? 

8376. Probability: 0.9779
 Yes , of course . It's really worth visiting . 

8377. Probability: 0.9896
 Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too . 

8378. Probability: 0.9862
 That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ? 

8379. Probability: 0.9766
 Too bad . I really like it . 

8380. Probability: 0.9900
 Thank you , you are so thoughtful . I think I could use some beers right now . 

8381. Probability: 0.9947
 I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ? 

8382. Probability: 0.9935
 Fantastic ! I can ’ t believe it ! That ’ s the biggest account we ’ Ve gotten so far ! 

8383. Probability: 0.9761
Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras . 

8384. Probability: 0.9950
 Wow ! 

8385. Probability: 0.9973
 You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone . 

8386. Probability: 0.9956
 Man , that's amazing . It must have cost a bundle . 

8387. Probability: 0.9839
 I'd like to . How do you like the hat ? 

8388. Probability: 0.9977
 How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful . 

8389. Probability: 0.9919
 It's interesting . Let me see . 

8390. Probability: 0.9720
 Thanks , Vivian . 

8391. Probability: 0.9846
 I see that you have some impressive writing experience . 

8392. Probability: 0.9741
 Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I'm also in the process of writing my first novel . 

8393. Probability: 0.9717
 Wonderful . I'd like to know why you're interested in this position at our paper . 

8394. Probability: 0.9772
 Gotcha . 

8395. Probability: 0.9769
 Perhaps it's the starter then ? 

8396. Probability: 0.9776
 Yes , that's possible . 

8397. Probability: 0.9763
 How about the monitor ? 

8398. Probability: 0.9811
 I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife . 

8399. Probability: 0.9962
 Very well , we have a couple of different options such as beaches , the wilderness , the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend . 

8400. Probability: 0.9922
 Perfect ! This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire . A free airport pick - up is included . Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger 

8401. Probability: 0.9914
 Sounds good ! What is the hotel that we will be staying at like ? 

8402. Probability: 0.9824
 That is the best part.Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests.You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this 

8403. Probability: 0.9975
 Wow ! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? 

8404. Probability: 0.9899
 Of course ! The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . You can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard . 

8405. Probability: 0.9838
 This one suits better . I will take it . 

8406. Probability: 0.9843
 Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? 

8407. Probability: 0.9776
 My pleasure , Sir . Bye . 

8408. Probability: 0.9717
 Hello , may I have a double cheeseburger ? 

8409. Probability: 0.9950
 That sounds great . 

8410. Probability: 0.9721
 Great . Here's my Visa Credit Card . 

8411. Probability: 0.9776
Some of them seem to be of the latest style . Now I ’ Ve a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish relations with you . 

8412. Probability: 0.9960
 That sounds interesting . I ’ ll send a fax home . As soon as I receive a definite answer , I ’ ll make a specific inquiry . 

8413. Probability: 0.9952
 Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller . 

8414. Probability: 0.9931
 That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? 

8415. Probability: 0.9952
 How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done . 

8416. Probability: 0.9909
 That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help . 

8417. Probability: 0.9963
 excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . 

8418. Probability: 0.9869
 that ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? 

8419. Probability: 0.9744
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . 

8420. Probability: 0.9780
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 

8421. Probability: 0.9769
 That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . 

8422. Probability: 0.9732
 It's the Automatic Teller Machine . 

8423. Probability: 0.9746
 Well , it gives me money , but it's my own money . 

8424. Probability: 0.9819
 Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 

8425. Probability: 0.9762
 OK , maybe you can try this one on . It's yellow . 

8426. Probability: 0.9860
 With pleasure , sir . May I suggest Steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks ? They are popular breakfast among Chinese people . 

8427. Probability: 0.9830
 So , that's steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks , and a Soya-bean milk . 

8428. Probability: 0.9955
 Lemon pie , hot cake in syrup , chocolate sundae and custard pudding .

8431. Probability: 0.9935
 Party all night ? Hotel California ? No kidding . Anyway , what's the room charge ? 

8432. Probability: 0.9767
 What about this one ? This one's got a label . 

8433. Probability: 0.9706
 Hey ! 

8434. Probability: 0.9710
 Yes , I ’ d like to book a single room with a bath from the afternoon of October 4th to the morning of October 10th . 

8435. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8436. Probability: 0.9889
 I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . 

8437. Probability: 0.9777
 Seriously , I am so excited . 

8438. Probability: 0.9889
 Yes . Good for you . 

8439. Probability: 0.9800
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 

8440. Probability: 0.9829
 Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . 

8441. Probability: 0.9701
 Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . 

8442. Probability: 0.9770
 No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . 

8443. Probability: 0.9881
 Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . 

8444. Probability: 0.9905
 I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? 

8445. Probability: 0.9775
 Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ? 

8446. Probability: 0.9804
 Yes , please . 

8447. Probability: 0.9917
 This lamb's very good . 

8448. Probability: 0.9982
 What about some steak ? This is a nice piece . 

8449. Probability: 0.9780
 Give me that piece please , and a pond of meet , too . 

8450. Probability: 0.9791
 Do you want a chicken , Mrs Bird ? They're very nice . 

8451. Probability: 0.9923
 No ! It's a perfect fit ! 

8452. Probability: 0.9766
 Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section . 

8453. Probability: 0.9980
 I especially like this flowery skirts . My fiancee will look very elegant in this . 

8454. Probability: 0.9932
 You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year . 

8455. Probability: 0.9733
 Oh , yes . I'll take this one . Can I pay by traveler ’ s check ? 

8456. Probability: 0.9977
Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here . 

8457. Probability: 0.9771
 Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there ! 

8458. Probability: 0.9948
 I said you are sure to like them . There is the Grand Parade Of Ants Carnival in a few minutes in the square . You will experience a dream of fantasy . 

8459. Probability: 0.9910
 All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom . 

8460. Probability: 0.9978
 That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ? 

8461. Probability: 0.9851
 that's very convenient . 

8462. Probability: 0.9847
 Oh , I have got it . How nice are the singers singing ! 

8463. Probability: 0.9798
 Can I try it on ?

 Let me see ... the train to New York City ... here it is ... daily except Sunday at 10,30 , 12,20 and 15,10 . 

8465. Probability: 0.9864
 Looks not bad . 

8466. Probability: 0.9816
 Sounds fine . 

8467. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8468. Probability: 0.9717
 Yes . 

8469. Probability: 0.9751
 Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current . 

8470. Probability: 0.9946
 Cool . What will they think of next ? How much are they ? 

8471. Probability: 0.9882
 Excellent ! Now what are the hours ? 

8472. Probability: 0.9886
 I'm going to change into my trunks right now ! 

8473. Probability: 0.9770
 I think you'll like the experience , sir . It's a great workout . 

8474. Probability: 0.9747
 Didn't you like it ? 

8475. Probability: 0.9749
 Yes . I'd like to choose a sweater for my son . 

8476. Probability: 0.9891
 I see . How about this one ? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers . 

8477. Probability: 0.9707
 Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture .

 No problem . Say ' cheese ' . That's good . Please wait a moment . 

8482. Probability: 0.9806
 They must have some special methods to do this during the process . 

8483. Probability: 0.9786
 That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . 

8484. Probability: 0.9933
 Oh , the packing looks very nice . 

8485. Probability: 0.9976
 The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . 

8486. Probability: 0.9746
 Good , what about the export packing ? 

8487. Probability: 0.9796
 Why not ?

 It seems perfect . 

8495. Probability: 0.9752
 Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves ! 

8496. Probability: 0.9927
 That sounds like a good idea ! But I'm afraid my mom will be angry about it . 

8497. Probability: 0.9789
 I don't know ... Hey , do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours ? 

8498. Probability: 0.9950

8502. Probability: 0.9702

 Great ! I ’ ll take it .

8506. Probability: 0.9883
 I'd like that . Alright , put on this apron first . 

8507. Probability: 0.9782
 Hmm , let me see ... Boil some water . 

8508. Probability: 0.9854
 Not bad . Okay , now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge . 

8509. Probability: 0.9718
 Sword , say it ' sword ' . 

8510. Probability: 0.9925
 Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time . 

8511. Probability: 0.9941
 I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity ! 

8512. Probability: 0.9975
 It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ? 

8513. Probability: 0.9744
 You know , art is something I've always been interested in ... 

8514. Probability: 0.9987
 Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . 

8515. Probability: 0.9729
 Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites .

 Appropriate greetings will win the interviewer's favorable impression 

8521. Probability: 0.9987
 It looks like it was made just for you . 

8522. Probability: 0.9768
 Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it . 

8523. Probability: 0.9796
 No , no limit . You can take as many as you want . 

8524. Probability: 0.9747
 That ’ s good . Thanks . 

8525. Probability: 0.9798
 Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan . 

8526. Probability: 0.9892
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? 

8527. Probability: 0.9769
 We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . 

8528. Probability: 0.9977
 I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . 

8529. Probability: 0.9708
 Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? 

8530. Probability: 0.9760
 So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? 

8531. Probability: 0.9764
 Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require .

8533. Probability: 0.9758
 Oh , it's delicious ... 

8534. Probability: 0.9876
 It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen . 

8535. Probability: 0.9995
 That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? 

8536. Probability: 0.9828
 I recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? 

8537. Probability: 0.9776
 What about the chicken ? 

8538. Probability: 0.9819
 How about the rice ? 

8539. Probability: 0.9866
 Oh , that's very considerate of you . I'lI take your word for it . 

8540. Probability: 0.9770
 Yes , I'd like a portion of that strawberry tart . 

8541. Probability: 0.9853
 Right . I'll see if I can catch the waitress's eye . 

8542. Probability: 0.9834
 Good . 

8543. Probability: 0.9717

 Great ! Many thanks ! 

8546. Probability: 0.9905

 Yes . 

8551. Probability: 0.9940
 That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ? 

8552. Probability: 0.9738
 I sure can . 

8553. Probability: 0.9861
 Great . See you then . 

8554. Probability: 0.9876
 I can believe it , and I am very excited about it . 

8555. Probability: 0.9858
 Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign .

8559. Probability: 0.9862
 How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? 

8560. Probability: 0.9720
 I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? 

8561. Probability: 0.9969
 Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . 

8562. Probability: 0.9767
 Really ? I ’ ll take it then . 

8563. Probability: 0.9746
 My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . 

8564. Probability: 0.9753
 Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . 

8565. Probability: 0.9917

8567. Probability: 0.9800
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 

8568. Probability: 0.9992
 That was a bright idea . 

8569. Probability: 0.9796
 Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer ? 

8570. Probability: 0.9717
 Really ? oh ! I'm glad you let me know . 

8571. Probability: 0.9747
 Let's run up and give him a hand . 

8572. Probability: 0.9729
 It's my pleasure . Hope you ’ ll visit Beijing more often . 

8573. Probability: 0.9855
 how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . 

8574. Probability: 0.9850
 Even better than a private vehicle is a limo . How does that sound ? 

8575. Probability: 0.9832
 Good . I'll get my coat and come downstairs . 

8576. Probability: 0.9728
 Great . Your order will take only one week .

8580. Probability: 0.9880
 Great . Thanks . 

8581. Probability: 0.9785
 I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night . 

8582. Probability: 0.9939
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' . 

8583. Probability: 0.9870
 how about spicy food ? 

8584. Probability: 0.9732
 Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic . 

8585. Probability: 0.9975

8588. Probability: 0.9735
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 

8589. Probability: 0.9996
 OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . 

8590. Probability: 0.9793
 Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . 

8591. Probability: 0.9988
 Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . 

8592. Probability: 0.9884
 Sure , this will be a really good picture .
