As I sit here, in early 2003, I have before me several pages of manuscript bearing majestically
encouraging and tactful notes from Ian Tattersal of the American Museum of Natural History
pointing out, inter alia, that Perigueux is not a wineproducing region, that it is inventive but a
touch unorthodox of me to italicize taxonomic divisions above the level of genus and species,
that I have persistently misspelled Olorgesaille, a place that I recently visited, and so on in
similar vein through two chapters of text covering his area of expertise, early humans."	0.9768906235694885

Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	I am delighted that you could make it.	0.9985660314559937
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"To begin with, for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble
in an intricate and intriguingly obliging manner to create you."	0.9930661916732788
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"It's an arrangement so
specialized and particular that it has never been tried before and will only exist this once."	0.9963595867156982

Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"(It is a slightly arresting notion
that if you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers, one atom at a time, you would produce a
mound of fine atomic dust, none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been
you.) Yet somehow for the period of your existence they will answer to a single overarching
impulse: to keep you you."	0.9944183826446533
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	Still, you may rejoice that it happens at all.	0.9849790334701538

Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"Without them there would be no water or air or rocks, no

make the universe so usefully material."	0.7205899357795715
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	There needn't actually be a universe at all.	0.861385703086853
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"But the fact that you have atoms and that they assemble in
such a willing manner is only part of what got you here."	0.9590869545936584
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"To be here now, alive in the twenty-
first century and smart enough to know it, you also had to be the beneficiary of an
extraordinary string of biological good fortune."	0.9402056336402893
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"You must be
prepared to change everything about yourself-shape, size, color, species affiliation,
everything-and to do so repeatedly."	0.8447864055633545
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"To get from ""protoplasmal primordial atomic globule"" (as the Gilbert and
Sullivan song put it) to sentient upright modern human has required you to mutate new traits
over and over in a precisely timely manner for an exceedingly long while."	0.724414050579071
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"So at various
periods over the last 3.8 billion years you have abhorred oxygen and then doted on it, grown
fins and limbs and jaunty sails, laid eggs, flicked the air with a forked tongue, been sleek,
been furry, lived underground, lived in trees, been as big as a deer and as small as a mouse,
and a million things more."	0.9875428080558777
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"The tiniest deviation from any of these evolutionary shifts, and you
might now be licking algae from cave walls or lolling walrus-like on some stony shore or
disgorging air through a blowhole in the top of your head before diving sixty feet for a
mouthful of delicious sandworms."	0.7254685163497925
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time immemorial to a favored
evolutionary line, but you have also been extremely-make that miraculously-fortunate in your
personal ancestry."	0.9389051198959351
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"This is a book about how it happened-in particular how we went from there being nothing at
all to there being something, and then how a little of that something turned into us, and also
some of what happened in between and since."	0.7895237803459167
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"That's a great deal to cover, of course, which is
why the book is called A Short History of Nearly Everything, even though it isn't really."	0.9415462613105774
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	But with luck by the time we finish it will feel as if it is.	0.8312842845916748
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"My own starting point, for what it's worth, was an illustrated science book that I had as a
classroom text when I was in fourth or fifth grade."	0.859754741191864
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"The book was a standard-issue 1950s
schoolbookbattered, unloved, grimly hefty-but near the front it had an illustration that just
captivated me: a cutaway diagram showing the Earth's interior as it would look if you cut into
the planet with a large knife and carefully withdrew a wedge representing about a quarter of
its bulk."	0.9281739592552185
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"It's hard to believe that there was ever a time when I had not seen such an illustration
before, but evidently I had not for I clearly remember being transfixed."	0.9940685629844666
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"I suspect, in honesty,
my initial interest was based on a private image of streams of unsuspecting eastbound
motorists in the American plains states plunging over the edge of a sudden 4,000-mile-high
cliff running between Central America and the North Pole, but gradually my attention did turn
in a more scholarly manner to the scientific import of the drawing and the realization that the
Earth consisted of discrete layers, ending in the center with a glowing sphere of iron and
nickel, which was as hot as the surface of the Sun, according to the caption, and I remember
thinking with real wonder: ""How do they know that?""
I didn't doubt the correctness of the information for an instant-I still tend to trust the
pronouncements of scientists in the way I trust those of surgeons, plumbers, and other
possessors of arcane and privileged information-but I couldn't for the life of me conceive how
any human mind could work out what spaces thousands of miles below us, that no eye had
ever seen and no X ray could penetrate, could look like and be made of."	0.7248865962028503
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"To me that was just a
miracle."	0.9801831245422363
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"Excited, I took the book home that night and opened it before dinner-an action that I expect
prompted my mother to feel my forehead and ask if I was all right-and, starting with the first
page, I read."	0.9420569539070129
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	And here's the thing.	0.9273843765258789
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	It wasn't actually altogether comprehensible.	0.7807425260543823
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	How did you figure it out?	0.7826766967773438
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"It was as if he wanted to keep the good stuff
secret by making all of it soberly unfathomable."	0.9488264918327332
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"As the years passed, I began to suspect that
this was not altogether a private impulse."	0.878714382648468
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"Then much later-about four or five years ago-I was on a long flight across the Pacific,
staring idly out the window at moonlit ocean, when it occurred to me with a certain
uncomfortable forcefulness that I didn't know the first thing about the only planet I was ever
going to live on."	0.7845346331596375
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"I had no idea, for example, why the oceans were salty but the Great Lakes
weren't."	0.7269660830497742
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"(I am very pleased to tell you that until the late 1970s scientists didn't know the
answers to these questions either."	0.8033539652824402
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"That to me remained the
greatest of all amazements-how scientists work things out."	0.97001051902771
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"So I decided that I would devote a portion of my life-three years, as it now turns out-to
reading books and journals and finding saintly, patient experts prepared to answer a lot of
outstandingly dumb questions."	0.8432899713516235
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	"The idea was to see if it isn't possible to understand and
appreciate-marvel at, enjoy even-the wonder and accomplishments of science at a level that
isn't too technical or demanding, but isn't entirely superficial either."	0.976065456867218
Green Hat Books\Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003).pdf	That was my idea and my hope, and that is what the book that follows is intended to be.	0.9641606211662292

Wilson and Penzias’s discovery the most distant galaxies anyone had ever detected were on
about the sixtieth floor, and the most distant things—quasars—were on about the twentieth."	0.8905086517333984

yank out every tiny hair on the back of my hand to get it free); then, once I had the mold, I
filled it with more plaster to make a model of my hand; then, I took that model and covered it
with 350 tiny interlocking triangles and polygons to create what looked like a net of black
lines on its “skin.” You may not think that a curved surface could be built out of such flat,
angular elements, but when you make them small enough, you can get pretty close."	0.9905551075935364

omy and a strategic priority for virtually every
CEO around the world.In fact,a recent IBM poll of fifteen hun-
dred CEOs identified creativity as the number-one “leadership
competency”ofthe future.1The power ofinnovative ideas to rev-
olutionize industries and generate wealth is evident from history:
Apple iPod outplays Sony Walkman, Starbucks’s beans and
atmosphere drown traditional coffee shops,Skype uses a strategy
of“free”to beat AT&T and British Telecom,eBay crushes classi-
fied ads,and Southwest Airlines flies under the radar ofAmerican
and Delta.In every case,the creative ideas ofinnovative entrepre-
neurs produced powerful competitive advantages and tremen-
dous wealth for the pioneering company."	0.9584015011787415

world with intensity beyond the ordinary.Others networked with
the most diverse people on the face ofthe earth.Still others placed
experimentation at the center of their innovative activity.When
engaged in consistently,these actions—questioning,observing,
networking,and experimenting—triggered associational think-
ing to deliver new businesses, products, services, and/or
processes.Most ofus think creativity is an entirely cognitive skill;
it all happens in the brain.A critical insight from our research is
that one’s ability to generate innovative ideas is not merely a func-
tion ofthe mind,but also a function ofbehaviors.This is good news
for us all because it means that ifwe change our behaviors,we can
improve our creative impact."	0.8691102266311646

produce the Macintosh computer,the first personal computer with

Reed College offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruc-

every label on every drawer,was beautifully hand-
calligraphed.Because I had dropped out and didn’t have
to take the normal classes,I decided to take a calligraphy
class to learn how to do this.I learned about serifand
sanseriftypefaces,about varying the amount ofspace
between different letter combinations,about what makes
great typography great.It was beautiful,historical,artisti-

found it fascinating.None ofthis had even a hope ofany
practical application in my life.But ten years later,when
we were designing the first Macintosh computer,it all

these skills later in the chapter and in chapter 8,but for now we
need only note that they are critical for delivering results and

Many innovators realize that they are deficient in these critical
skills and,consequently,try to team up with others who possess
them.For example,eBay founder Omidyar quickly recognized the
need for execution skills,so he invited JeffSkoll,a Stanford MBA,
and Meg Whitman,a Harvard MBA,to join him.“JeffSkoll and I
had very complementary skills,”Omidyar told us.“I’d say I did
more of the creative work developing the product and solving
problems around the product,while Jeffwas involved in the more
analytical and practical side ofthings.He was the one who would
listen to an idea of mine and then say,‘Ok,let’s figure out how to

the late nineties and watching the emergence ofAmazon.com and
eBay ...it felt like something significant was on the horizon.”

changing technological landscape—and his own career.So he took
a sabbatical that started with a trip to India where he met avariety
of diverse people, including spiritual leader and humanitarian,
Mata Amritanandamayi (who helped strengthen his commitment

this global journey was Hawaii,where he discussed various ideas

Benioff’s synthesis ofnovel inputs or association—“enterprise
software meets Amazon”—challenged the industry tradition of
selling software on CD-ROMs and engaging companies in lengthy,
customized (and expensive) installation processes,andinstead fo-
cused on delivering software as a service over the Internet.That
way,the software would be available 24/7,and companies would
avoid all the costs and shutdowns associated with ongoing,large-
scale IT system installations and upgrades.Given his substantial
experience in sales and marketing at Oracle,Beniofffelt that pro-
viding software services for managing a sales force and customer
relations carried huge potential for small and medium-sized busi-

Salesforce.com was born."	0.9725064039230347

After years of building a large stock of ideas through active
questioning,observing,networking,and experimenting,innova-
tors often make the most surprising associations.Sometimes an as-
sociation or idea sparked at the very moment they were engaged in
questioning,observing,networking or experimenting (as described
in chapters 3 through 6).Equally often,innovators uncovered new
ideas while in a relaxed state,without distractions,when they were

not “trying”to solve a problem (researchers describe this as “defo-
cusing their attention”).In other words,it rarely happened during
a meeting when they were in a focused,convergent thinking mode
searching for a solution to a particular problem.Instead,Diane
Greene (cofounder ofVMWare) told us that “the shower”is a great
place to relax and think to get new ideas (a place frequently pitched
by many innovators we interviewed,including David Neeleman
[founder ofJetBlue and Azul] and JeffJones [founder ofCampus
Pipeline and NxLight]).Innovators also unearth new ideas while
walking,driving,on vacation,or in the middle ofthe night (as Pep-
siCo CEO Nooyi does).Benioff got the key inspiration for Sales-
force.com when “swimming with the dolphins.” In addition to
hitting the shower,Greene gets some of her best new associations
when sailing solo (which she has done since childhood).In short,
Greene explained,“You get more creativity by giving yourself the
space for ideas to simmer.Ideas come from having a longer time
horizon about what you’re thinking about and a broader view of
where the idea might be going to go.”The point is that you can
sometimes spend too much time deliberately attacking a problem
when some creative ideas will only emerge after putting yourselfin
a relaxed state with no distractions.6Ifall else fails when trying to
figure out a problem,go to sleep.Yes,Harvard researchers have
found that sleep is a consistent antidote to tunnel vision toward a
problem.So when find yourself stuck in a thinking rut,give the
problem extra time to percolate by adding some sleep into the mix."	0.9800561666488647

Tip #4: Build your own curiosity box
Start a collection of odd, interesting things (e.g., a slinky,
model airplane,robot,and so on) and put them in a curiosity box
or bag (as people in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries did
when they used curiosity cabinets to store interesting objects from
around the world).Then,you can pull out unique items randomly
when confronted with a problem or opportunity (and if you’re
really daring,display them on your office shelves).When traveling
(or even at home),visit local second-hand shops and flea markets
in a new city to pick up surprising treasures (ranging from a

chairman ofBain & Company.As a child growing up in Israel,she
was fascinated by many things and “always asking a hundred ques-
tions.”Her parents also encouraged her to ask questions when
called on in class,and she did.So much so that her eighth grade
teacher wrote in her yearbook:“Orit,always ask those two ques-
tions,and even a third and a fourth question.Don’t ever stop being
curious.”When reading this teacher’s comment,Gadiesh realized
for the first time that “asking questions was the true way to go.”
Later in life,she relied on the same approach to cocreate client in-
sights at Bain,knowing that “asking clients lots ofquestions is key
to generating powerful solutions to problems.”
For example,in the early 1980s,Gadiesh was fresh out ofgrad-
uate school and new at consulting.She was assigned to help a steel-
manufacturing client cut its costs to stay competitive.During her
first visit to the plant,she was warned by the over-sixty-year-old
CEO that women were “bad luck in the industry.”Undaunted,she
pressed forward with the client,asking question after question about
why it was doing what it was doing.At the time,there were two ways
to make steel, the standard process of pouring it into ingots or,
alternatively,continuous casting (then,a new technology),where
you literally cast the steel continuously and cut it into slabs."	0.9232054352760315

Questioning
Here’s where Gadiesh’s questioning skills best tackled the
client’s problem.She went to visit customers and started asking
questions,“Do you really need three hundred fifty products?”
“Why do you need all three hundred fifty products?”Their initial
autopilot answer was yes,but as she probed further with additional
questions,it became clear that customers didn’t fully grasp the cost
advantages that continuous casting offered due to its unique ca-
pacity to add other (lower-cost) materials during the steel-casting
process.Working with the client and customers,Gadiesh literally
went through each of the three hundred fifty products asking,
“Why do you have this?"	0.9525516629219055

moved from understanding what was to exploring in depth what
might be.She moved deeper into disruptive territory by asking fun-
damental questions such as:“What ifwe shrink the existing product
line by 90 percent?”“What if we cast steel continuously with that
sharply reduced product line?”“How might we maximize the addi-
tion of cost-saving materials when casting the steel?”Before long,
the steel company executives realized that reducing the number of
products from three hundred fifty to thirty not only was possible
but was the most profitable course ofaction because it would give
them a competitive advantage in the product segments in which
they did compete.This allowed them to add other materials like alu-
minum (thus reducing costs) through a new continuous-casting
process,while still meeting most oftheir key customers’needs.The

Innovators constantly question common wisdom.Aaron Garrity,

A few years ago, we stumbled across an incredibly valuable
questioning tool.We were teaching a graduate business school class
and found ourselves stuck on a particular problem,unable to find

of us suggested taking a time-out from the process and focusing
our collective energies on only asking questions about the prob-
lem,instead oftrying to construct another set ofsolutions.Much
to our surprise,the questions-only approach dug much deeper
into the fundamental elements ofthe challenge and opened every-
one’s eyes to a new understanding ofthe problem."	0.9320911765098572

thinkers.One executive in a large pharmaceutical company started
writing down questions for fifteen to twenty minutes each morn-
ing before work.Three months later,his boss told him that he had
become the best strategic thinker in his business unit.Six months
later,he was promoted.Practice does make perfect,or at least bet-
ter,when it comes to questioning.So ifyour “questioning muscles
have atrophied,”as Ahmet Bozer (Eurasia and Africa Group pres-
ident at Coca-Cola) recognized after a recent QuestionStorming
workshop with his senior team,“it’s time to start exercising those
muscles.”
Tip #2: Cultivate question thinking
When identifying problems or challenges,we often describe
them as statements.In fact,we often ask groups of executives to
identify their top-three challenges.As they wrestle with the task
and identify these challenges,they typically frame them as state-
ments.We then give the group an additional five to ten minutes to
reformulate their top-three challenges into their top-three ques-
tions (about leading innovation effectively,for example).We have
found that actively translating statements into questions not only
helps sharpen problem statements,but also evokes more personal
responsibility for the problems and moves them to take more ac-
tive next steps in the pursuit ofanswers."	0.8900538086891174

around the scooter,so that those using them could be safer if it
fell.Could there be a four-wheel vehicle made of scooter parts?”

Observing
Tata’s experience with the Nano illustrates this idea.Ratan Tata’s
initial observation of the Indian family on a scooter in the rain led
him to realize that the scooter wasn’t doing a very good jobat trans-
porting the family in a safe or dry manner.They needed a vehicle like
a car that would provide more protection.This led to years of ex-
perimenting to create an affordable car that would be within reach of
these middle-class families.But just being able to build an affordable
car wasn’t enough.To truly put Indian customers in the driver’s seat,
Tata needed to provide a set of complementary services that were
critical to a customer’s ability to buy a car,finance it,insure it,learn
to operate it safely,and then drive it home.Tata’s success was borne
oftwo types ofobservations:one about the job to be done (transport
families safely in a vehicle they could afford) and one about how to
actually put a middle-class Indian in the driver’s seat (take the cars to
the village markets and provide the necessary services so the cus-
tomer could operate the vehicle within a single day)."	0.9142031669616699

Observing
In similar fashion,Scott Cook founded Intuit,maker of the
popular financial software Quicken and QuickBooks,based on two
key observations.The first was a simple observation within his
home.He hit on the idea for Quicken by watching his wife work
on their finances and hearing her complain about how frustrating
and time consuming it was.“She’s got a good mind for math and
is quite organized,so she handles the bills for us,”Cook said.“But
she frequently complained that it was a waste of time and book-
keeping was a hassle.So it was that observation combined with an
understanding ofwhat personal computers could do well and not
do well that started Intuit.”

computers “could do well and not do well”?"	0.9029625058174133

blood pressure,but he also noticed that there weren’t any good
“plumber tools,”to manage the flow of blood.“There weren’t re-

So Crocker eventually left Baxter to start a company that cre-
ated a variety of specialized devices to control the flow of blood
during cardiac surgery.One device,Visuflo with Light Source,ad-

providing an ancillary light source that could be directed into the
surgical opening.Without these devices,surgeons would come up
with their own ways to get more light into a surgical opening

or their own techniques to remove unwanted blood flow (for
example,trying different suction devices to remove blood).The
insights for Crocker’s innovative devices came only after carefully

cardiac surgery and the workarounds they developed to solve those

For example,OpenTable.com is a more comprehensive solution
to the workarounds that we typically use when trying to have a great
dining experience (the job to be done).The key elements include
finding a restaurant that offers the desired quality of food and at-
mosphere,reserving a table at a convenient time without a wait,and
getting a reasonable price for the meal.Finding the right restaurant
often involves asking for referrals or reading restaurant reviews.After
finding the right restaurant,you then call to make a reservation.If
the restaurant doesn’t take reservations or has no reservation avail-
able,then you start the process again.You might even simply go to
the restaurant early—or possibly send someone to wait in line for
you—in order to ensure you get a table or to minimize waiting time."	0.7893005609512329

ton launched an online app that is essentially your own restaurant
concierge service:it allows customers to quickly and easily find a
restaurant they might like (by providing insightful reviews and
customer ratings),get a reservation at a convenient time (by al-
lowing customers to see table availability and book their own
reservation),and even have access to discounted meals (by giving
points for meal discounts).Restaurants pay OpenTable $199 per
month for the reservation service (to essentially rent a computer

While watching people trying to do a job to gain insights for
new product or service offerings seems straightforward,most com-
pany managers spend little time in this simple, commonsense
approach.But when companies uncover the hidden needs of the
customer through observation (whether it be serendipitous obser-
vation,live-in immersion,or video observation),they gain insights
that can prove extremely valuable.IDEO’s Kelley reports that when
designing a new kids’toothbrush for Oral-B,IDEO went out in the
field to watch kids brush their teeth.What it noticed was that kids’
toothbrushes were just smaller versions of adult toothbrushes,
which proved to be a challenge for them to hold and maneuver be-
cause they lacked the dexterity of their parents.This led to an in-

easier for kids to hold and use.The result?"	0.9709987640380859

Tip #2: Observe companies

Tip #3: Observe whatever strikes your fancy
Set aside ten minutes each day to simply observe something in-
tensively.Take careful notes about your observations.Then try to
figure out how what you are seeing might lead to a new strategy,
product,service,or production process.When you are out and
about watching the world,jot down your key observations and
thoughts on a notepad,and review your notes later,after a little
time has passed.Keep a small camera (still or video) with you to
take pictures ofinteresting things.The camera can remind you to
observe and note what is going on around you.(Amazon’s Bezos
confided that he often takes pictures of“really bad innovations”
to get ideas for things that might be done better.)
Tip #4: Observe with all your senses
As you observe customers, companies, or whatever, actively
engage more than one sense (see,smell,hear,touch,taste).One
structured way to do this is through Dialogue in the Dark (a prac-
tice developed by Andreas Heinecke) and Dialogue in Silence
100092 04 089-112 r1 go.qxp 5/13/11 9:59 AM Page 111
111
Observing
(apractice developed by Heinecke and his wife Orna Cohen).In
these tours by visually or hearing-impaired guides,guests experi-
ence darkened or silent environments (ranging from permanent
exhibitions to restaurants located throughout the world) and enter
a completely different world of either darkness or silence.A less
structured approach to engaging your senses is to simply and in-
tentionally become aware of your wider range of senses.For ex-
ample,pay attention to what you smell next time you’re visiting
with customers (as Schultz did in Italy) or eat your next dinner in
slow motion,slowly savoring every bite and focusing only on the
taste,texture,and smell ofthe food.Or notice how a product really
feels as you touch it (when either using it or trying to understand
how it works).As you learn how to observe,pay close attention to
any creative insights the experience might trigger.Be sure to cap-
ture observations (sights,smells,sounds,touches,and tastes) in
your idea journal and explore where the insights might lead you."	0.9594652056694031

HINKING OUTSIDE THE box often requires link-
ing the ideas in your area of knowledge with
those ofothers who play in different boxes,who are outside your
sphere.Innovators gain a radically different perspective when they
devote time and energy to finding and testing ideas through a net-
work ofdiverse individuals.Unlike typical delivery-driven execu-
tives who network to access resources, sell themselves or their
companies,or boost their careers,innovators go out of their way
to meet people with different backgrounds and perspectives to ex-
tend their own knowledge."	0.9156497716903687

Coca-Cola.The technology allowed vending machines to wire-

life of personal computers and before people owned cell phones,
so sending data wirelessly to a machine was cutting-edge tech-
nology.) “That’s when it hit me ...I remembered what my teacher
had said in high school,”recalls Lazaridis.“‘Don’t get too caught up
with computers,because it’s going to be the person that puts wire-
less technology and computers together that’s going to make a big
difference.’”
At this moment,Lazardis thought of creating an interactive
pager,a product allowing people to wirelessly send data and in-
formation to each other.So RIM sold the rights to the LED display
sign product to Corman Technologies and focused its full atten-
tion on the wireless technologies necessary to create interactive
pagers—the precursor to RIM’s blockbuster BlackBerry smart-
phone.“I realized that’s what I wanted to do,”Lazardis told us,“and
since then,that’s all we’ve done.Frankly we’ve never looked back.”

ideas.For example,innovative entrepreneurs JeffJones (founder of
Campus Pipeline and NxLight) and Eliot Jacobsen (RocketFuel
Ventures) described how they liked to get together to jam (to use

Ilike to get together with when I’m in need ofa boost to my cre-

I love to talk to because we just energize each other and build on

those people I like to talk to on a regular basis because we just con-
nect in a creative way.”
In similar fashion,we found that many innovators have a small
group ofcreative confidants that they converse with whenever they
need some fresh ideas—or someone to challenge their current
ideas.Usually this network is relatively small (e.g.,fewer than five
people),but some innovators have actively created larger networks."	0.9956569075584412

unofficial group.It’s fairly senior,fairly seasoned people who are
comfortable throwing out ideas and then forgetting about them if
these hunches or speculations aren’t right.One thing about being
a CEO is that you’ve got to be very careful about what you say in
public and whom you involve in these conversations.That’s why
networking for ideas,for me at least,is unofficial.”For this reason,

stayed at an ashram in India or dropped in on calligraphy classes
at Reed College.The second is taking things apart—either physi-
cally or intellectually,as Michael Dell did when,at age sixteen,he
disassembled a personal computer (more about this later).The
third is testing an idea through pilots and prototypes,as Black-
Berry inventor Michael Lazaridis did when trying to construct a
Star Trek-like force field in high school with wire,electricity,and
chemicals.We found that innovators often generated their best
ideas when engaged in one of the three different experimenting
approaches."	0.854881763458252

Experimenting
“I haven’t failed ...I’ve just found 10,000 ways that do not work.”
But we found that a much broader interpretation ofexperiment-
ing better reflects how innovators cultivate new ideas.For exam-
ple,when simply trying out a new experience,you have no explicit
intention to test an idea.It’s simply an exploratory journey to see
what you can learn.The same can be said for taking things apart,
either physically or intellectually.When Dell disassembled his first
personal computer,he wasn’t looking to create a new computer or
company;he just wanted to see how it worked.Experimenting can
also involve launching a pilot or prototype,and then modifying it
as you go along.Bezos’s online bookstore didn’t stay where it was
after its initial success;it morphed into an online discount retailer,
selling a full line of products from toys to consumer electronics."	0.7956722974777222

As in Jobs’s experience with calligraphy,Murdock had no way of
knowing that collecting cow pies could lead to any practical ap-
plication in her life.It all started because she was curious enough
to collect a few cow pies while wandering in the desert.Murdock
jokingly sums up her success saying,“I’m an entre-manure.”
Innovators like Bezos and Murdock seem to intuitively under-
stand the value that can come from trying out new experiences in
new environments.Our research on innovators revealed that one
ofthe most powerful experiments innovators can try out is living
and working in different cultures.The more countries someone
lives in,the more likely he or she is to leverage that experience to
deliver innovative products,processes,or businesses.Individuals
who live in a foreign country for at least three months are 35 per-
cent more likely to start an innovative venture or invent a product
(each additional country brings additional benefit,though there
are diminishing returns after living in two countries).Moreover,if
managers try out even one international assignment before be-
coming CEO,their companies deliver stronger financial results
than companies run by CEOs without such experience,roughly
7percent higher market performance on average.2And part ofthat
performance premium comes from the innovation capability that
a CEO has acquired by living overseas."	0.968795120716095

as an insulator to keep dry suits warm.He thought,“Hey,that’s a

time.) This experience was the catalyst for the creation of the
Klymit vest (insulated with argon gas) and a variety ofother prod-

Dell soon gained enough familiarity with the cost ofPC com-

Pilot idea,you could just hand the other guy a check.But in the

service in the first year.Trying different experiments was critical to
designing a successful business model.As Hyman told us,“Our
revenue growth is amazing.This is a dream come true.”
As we studied innovators and their experiments,one thing we
noticed was that the amount of experimenting required to gain
new insights is almost the inverse of the amount of prior ques-
tioning,observing,and networking they had done.In other words,
if you haven’t done much questioning,observing,or networking
(or haven’t done them well), then you will have to run more
experiments to gain the insights required to move forward.For
example, Rent the Runway’s experiments were able to be care-
fullycrafted to generate the right data because of years of obser-
vations that Hyman,in particular,had made ofthe needs ofyoung
women attending special events.(Hyman had worked for years
at Starwood Hotels where she launched programs to meet the
needs of wedding parties and honeymooners;she also worked at
WeddingChannel.com and IMG,one of the world’s top firms for
female models.) As a result,she had a deep knowledge ofthe needs
of fashion-oriented young women,special events,and designers
and designer clothing.This allowed her and Fleiss to design better
experiments to test their ideas."	0.9424782991409302

DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION STARTS WITH YOU
Kelleher of Southwest Airlines told us that the original low-cost
airline entrant stumbled onto its quick-turnaround capability
when financial pressures forced the company to service its routes
with three planes instead of the four it had originally planned to
use.It had to either cancel flights or figure out a way to fly a four-
plane schedule with three planes.This led management to develop
a new set of practices for turning the plane around as quickly as
possible,eventually leading to a fifteen-minute plane turnaround."	0.7817526459693909

candidates whether they’ve ever invented anything,it sends a pow-
erful signal that invention is expected and valued.“I also look for

you believe the world can change,then it’s not a stretch to believe
you can be a part ofit.”

our employees to experiment.In fact,we have a group called Web
Lab that is charged with constantly experimenting with the user
interface on the Web site to figure out improvements for the

culture made by MIT’s Edgar Schein in his classic work Orga-
nizational Culture and Leadership.Schein argues that organiza-
tional culture arises during the early stages of an organization
when it faces particular problems or must accomplish particular
tasks.For example,the challenge might be:“How do we develop a
new product?” or “How do we deal with this customer’s com-
plaint?”In each instance,organization members responsible for
resolving the problem sit down and decide on a method for re-
solving it.Ifthe method works successfully,the organization likely
uses it again and again when faced with similar problems and it
becomes part of the organization’s culture (a taken-for-granted
way for how the organization addresses certain problems).If it
does not work well,the organization’s leaders will devise a differ-
ent method for solving the problem and continue to search until
a method successfully solves it.As any particular method for solv-
ing a problem is profitably used over and over,it becomes part of
the culture."	0.7456969022750854

These organizational discovery processes are supported by four
guiding philosophies that imbue employees with the courage to
try out new ideas:(1) innovation is everyone’s job,(2) disruptive
innovation is part of our innovation portfolio,(3) deploy lots of
small,properly organized innovation project teams,and (4) take
smart risks in the pursuit of innovation.Together,these philoso-
phies reflect the courage-to-innovate attitudes of innovative
leaders.They believe innovation is their job,so they constantly
challenge the status quo and aren’t afraid to take risks to make
change happen.To illustrate,the most innovative companies don’t
relegate R&D to one unit.Instead,virtually everyone,including
the top management team,is expected to come up with new ideas,
which results in a democratization ofinnovation efforts.The no-
tion that everyone should innovate and challenge the status quo is
supported by a risk-taking philosophy,such as IDEO’s “fail soon to
succeed sooner.”The remarkable companies we studied not only
show a tolerance for failure;they see failure as impossible to avoid
and a natural part ofthe innovation process.Moreover,since they
believe that everyone can be creative,they work hard to keep units
small so that each employee feels empowered and responsible for
innovating (Amazon’s Bezos employs a “Two Pizza Team”rule,
meaning that teams should be small enough—six to ten people—
to be adequately fed by two pizzas)."	0.9184938669204712

The DNA of the World’s Most Innovative Companies
As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter,chapters 2
through 6 focused primarily on how individual innovators do their
work.In this chapter,we’ve suggested that the innovator’s DNA
has some clear organizational analogs and applications.We think
there are equally compelling applications to teams at work (where
the principles apply as they do with individuals and organiza-
tions).We believe this because the boundaries between what an
organization is and what a team is are becoming increasingly
blurred in our fast-paced world where organizations like Vodafone
start entirely new business units with twelve people.Is that an or-
ganization or a team?"	0.7673838138580322

yet another way.”By simply watching Lafley’s everyday actions and
noticing how much time he personally spent generating new ideas,
his team (and organization) “got it”about innovation.Lafley also
demonstrated that innovation is just not an individual game but,
in the end,a powerful team effort.“You remember the times when
nobody knewwhat to do and you came through with something
that people didn’t think you could come through with or when
you create something that people didn’t think could be created,”
Lafley observed.“When this happens in our company,it’s never
one person.It’s always a group ...Getting everybody in the same
boat,rolling in the same direction,that is really what’s fun.Espe-
cially when you win.”
These innovation premium data on CEO impacts at Apple and
P&G reflect a key finding in our research that if top executives
want innovation,they need to stop pointing their fingers at some-
one else and take a hard look at themselves.They must lead the
innovation charge by understanding how innovation works,im-
proving their own discovery skills,and sharpening their ability to
foster others’innovation.Moreover,they must actively populate

Discovery-Driven People
Leaders ofhighly innovative organizations understand the critical
need to attract creative people if the company hopes to build a
cadre ofinnovators at all levels.“In most things in life,the dynamic
range between average quality and the best quality is,at most,two-
to-one.”Steve Jobs discerned.“But,in the field that I was inter-
ested in—originally hardware design—I noticed that the dynamic
range between what an average person could accomplish and what
the best person could accomplish was 50 or 100 to 1.Given that,
you’re well advised to go after the cream ofthe cream.That’s what
we’ve done.A small team of A+ players can run circles around a
giant team ofB and C players.That’s what I’ve tried to do.”So how
do highly innovative companies find employees that rate A+ for
innovation?"	0.9331974387168884

new ideas,”you must “make your creativity apparent,”and you must
show “a track record of thinking different.”Virgin describes its
people as “easy to spot.They act in unusual ways,as it’s the only way
they know how.But it’s not forced—it’s natural.They are honest,
cheeky,questioning,amusing,disruptive,intelligent,and restless.”

and Clark use the term “breakthrough”projects to refer to what we
have called “disruptive”projects).4We see Apple’s MacBook Air lap-
top as a platform innovation project because it’s different enough
to be viewed as a new product category but fails to open an entirely
new market as the iPod did,since most MacBook Air users are al-
ready users ofsmall laptops or other Apple computers.Moreover,
the technologies behind MacBook Air are a bit less radical than
for breakthrough products like the iPod and iTunes.(Of course,
we can always debate the degree to which any given product is based
on radical technologies [new components,new linkages among
components] or whether it opens up a new market by offering a
value proposition markedly different from other products.)
For us,the framework in figure 10-2 illustrates how innovative
companies consciously allocate a significantly greater proportion of
people and resources to platform and breakthrough (disruptive) in-
novation projects.For example,Google uses a 70-20-10 rule for
allocating engineering efforts, including the 20 percent project
time granted to technical staff.Google devotes 70 percent ofengi-
neering time to expanding and developing derivative products
within the core business, that is, Web search and paid listings;
20percent to projects designed to “extend the core,”such as Gmail
or Google Docs;and 10 percent to build “fundamentally new busi-
nesses,”such as the Nexus One phone (its first device),a new col-
laborative tool called Wave,free Wi-Fi service in San Francisco,or
Google Editions (its own e-book store).From our perspective,the
70-20-10 prioritization maps well with Wheelwright and Clark’s
“derivative,”“platform,”and “breakthrough”innovation project
categories.Google’s prioritization demonstrates a willingness to
invest in platform and breakthrough innovation projects.“We will
not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects because of
short-term earnings pressure,”wrote Page in a letter to sharehold-
ers at Google’s IPO.“For example,we would fund projects that
have a 10 percent chance ofearning a billion dollars over the long

term.Do not be surprised if we place smaller bets in areas that
seem very speculative or even strange.”5
Similarly,Apple and Amazon allocate significant resources to
platform and breakthrough innovation projects (though they
don’t appear to follow any specific resource-allocation guidelines)."	0.8519326448440552

Somehow pursuing disruptive innovations with this type ofteam
feels less risky (than doing it with a more common delivery-driven
management team) because these folks boast strong discovery
skills and understand the behaviors (and processes) required for
generating a successful disruption.No wonder the risk seems more
calculated with them.The actual risk islow because putting the right
people and innovation processes into place increases the proba-
bility ofsuccess (and decreases the probability oftaking disastrous
steps)."	0.9683895707130432

Sandrock,CEO ofthe Branson Centre for Entrepreneurship,told
us that she lives by the question,“How do I do this now?”and
works tirelessly to help emerging entrepreneurs in South Africa do

economist Frank Knight saw innovative entrepreneurs as a class
ofindividuals with the “disposition to act”in spite ofthe uncertain
context in which they operated.We heard this over and over from
various innovators,including Virgin’s Branson who lives by,“Screw
it,Let’s do it,”and Skype’s Zennström,who made the following
analogy between action and entrepreneurial success:
Say that you have one ofthose reality shows on TV and
you drop a bunch ofpeople in the middle ofa desert
island.The winner is the person who gets to the shore the
quickest.Some people try to analyze where they are,which
direction to go.Some ofthem say,“Let’s climb up a tree or
a rock or hillside and maybe we can see further and figure
out what is the best direction to go.”They will spend time
planning and analyzing how to find the best direction to
go.But some other people will just look around,follow
their intuition,and start running in a direction."	0.8887873888015747

Research Methods
Our research project consisted of two phases: (1) an inductive
study ofinnovators compared with noninnovators,and (2) a large
sample study comparison of roughly eighty innovators and
roughly four hundred noninnovator executives (we later expanded
this to a larger sample).We conducted exploratory interviews with
a sample ofroughly thirty innovative entrepreneurs and a similar
number of senior executives in larger organizations (see a sub-
sample ofinnovators we interviewed in appendix A).The goal of
our interviews with innovators was to understand when and how
they personally came up with creative ideas on which they built
new innovative businesses.We asked questions such as:
