3,350,I'll have a go . __eou__,Y
0,351,Don't tell me that's your lunch ?,N
1,351,"No , this is just my appetizer ... this is my lunch !",N
2,351,A candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch ! That's all junk !,N

1,353,"Everything about them was different , even the theaters .",Y
2,353,I'm really interested . Tell me about them .,Y
3,353,"Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family .",Y
4,353,That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food .,Y
5,353,"We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie .",Y
6,353,Why don't we do that anymore ?,N
7,353,"Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . __eou__",Y
0,354,Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?,N
1,354,"Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .",Y
2,354,Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?,Y
3,354,Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .,Y
4,354,I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .,N
5,354,Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .,Y
6,354,"Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .",Y

9,355,You do ?,N
10,355,I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .,N
11,355,"I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .",N
12,355,"Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?",N
13,355,What kind of deal ?,N
14,355,I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .,N
15,355,You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?,N
16,355,I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .,N
17,355,"If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?",N
18,355,"Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .",N
19,355,"It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! __eou__",N
0,356,Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?,N
1,356,I did . Why ?,N
2,356,Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?,N
3,356,"No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . __eou__",N
0,357,I'm going crazy .,N

4,358,"Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some .",Y

2,359,"No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .",Y
3,359,"There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?",N
4,359,200 dollars per week .,N
5,359,"In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .",Y
6,359,"It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .",Y
7,359,"Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .",Y
8,359,Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ?,Y
9,359,I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?,N
10,359,Twice a week for work and once for shopping .,Y
11,359,"In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .",Y
12,359,"That's true . Ok , I will think about it . __eou__",N

4,360,Sounds interesting . What about this ?,Y

7,360,It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste .,Y
8,360,I will take the jasmine tea . Could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? It is a gift for my friend .,N
9,360,No problem . Wait for a moment . __eou__,N
0,361,Can I help you ?,N
1,361,I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ?,N
2,361,Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food .,Y
3,361,Moon cakes ? What is that ?,N
4,361,The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony .,Y
5,361,Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people .,N
6,361,"All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style .",Y
7,361,What's the difference between these two styles ?,Y
8,361,The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts .,Y

0,363,"Excuse me , I have something to trouble you .",N
1,363,Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .,N
2,363,"An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .",N
3,363,"Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?",N
4,363,I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .,N
5,363,"Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?",N
6,363,"Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .",N
7,363,It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?,Y

2,364,"Look , this is a pimple !",N
3,364,"Oh , I think it is .",N
4,364,How come ?,N
5,364,I think it's because of your bad habits !,N
6,364,"I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot .",N
7,364,"I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem .",N
8,364,I wasn't aware of that !,N
9,364,You should do better later . __eou__,N
0,365,Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded .,N

5,368,"Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .",Y
6,368,"In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ?",Y
7,368,That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?,Y
8,368,That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . __eou__,N
0,369,What is this big box at the front door ?,N
1,369,Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print .,N

3,369,I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months .,N
4,369,"So , what's in the box ? A fridge ?",N

7,369,Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ? __eou__,N

7,370,"Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .",N
8,370,What did you do ?,N
9,370,I shouted it back of course .,N

1,371,I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend .,N
2,371,Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?,N
3,371,She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance .,Y
4,371,"OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes .",N
5,371,Which one would you recommend ?,N
6,371,"Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?",N
7,371,"That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please .",N
8,371,Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .,N
9,371,"It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy .",N
10,371,How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .,Y
11,371,She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big .,N
12,371,How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger .,Y
13,371,"No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is .",N
14,371,I know what she would like-some whitening cream .,N
15,371,"No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter .",N
16,371,Will that be all then ?,N
17,371,"That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks . __eou__",N
0,372,"Good morning , madam . Can I help you ?",N
1,372,I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ?,N
2,372,Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel .,Y
3,372,Anything that can keep my skin clean will do .,N
4,372,How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy .,Y
5,372,"Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance .",N
6,372,"We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it .",Y
7,372,I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ?,N
8,372,"Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic .",N
9,372,"I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later .",N
10,372,"Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . __eou__",N
0,373,What did you buy at the market ?,N
1,373,I bought some special local products .,N
2,373,You seem to have bought the whole market !,N
3,373,"Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut .",Y
4,373,Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals .,Y
5,373,Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ?,N
6,373,"All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes .",Y
7,373,Then I will buy some tomorrow .,N
8,373,Why do you want to buy so much ?,N
9,373,Because I want to send them to my friends .,N
10,373,I see . __eou__,Y
0,374,Are there pets allowed in this apartment ?,N
1,374,"No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed .",N
2,374,What about a boa constrictor ?,Y
3,374,Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ?,N
4,374,"If I had one , could I rent this apartment ?",N
5,374,I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock .,Y
6,374,What about a Gila monster ?,Y
7,374,"I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here . __eou__",N
0,375,"Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams .",Y
1,375,Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ?,Y
2,375,I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one .,Y
3,375,You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ?,N
4,375,"I know , I know . I will do it all by myself .",N
5,375,Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ?,N
6,375,Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already .,N
7,375,Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this . __eou__,N
0,376,"Beth , would you like me to help you carry it ?",N
1,376,"Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble .",N
2,376,Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all . __eou__,N
0,377,I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ?,Y
1,377,Sure . Let's buy it . __eou__,N
0,378,Help ! I'm about to drop these books .,N
1,378,I've got them .,N

1,379,I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ?,Y
2,379,I'd like to . How do you like the hat ?,N
3,379,It's not special . It can be seen everywhere .,N
4,379,How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful .,Y
5,379,It's interesting . Let me see .,Y
6,379,Do you like it ?,N
7,379,"Yes , how much is it ?",N
8,379,Fifty yuan .,N
9,379,"OK , I'll take it . __eou__",N
0,380,"Where are you going , Tony ?",N
1,380,It's none of your business .,N
2,380,Mom said you couldn't go out .,N
3,380,I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . __eou__,N
0,381,Has someone already helped you ?,N
1,381,"No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot .",N
2,381,Which do you like best ?,N
3,381,That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ?,N
4,381,360 yuan .,N
5,381,"Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here .",N
6,381,"Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock .",N
7,381,I do like it . Can you come down a bit ?,N
8,381,I can give you a 10 % discount .,N
9,381,That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ?,Y
10,381,I'm afraid that's the best we can do .,N
11,381,"If so , I'd better try another store . __eou__",N
0,382,"So how far is the museum , dad ?",N
1,382,It is about 10 minutes walk .,N
2,382,Finish your hot chocolate and we will go .,N
3,382,Are we going to come back here for lunch ?,N
4,382,"No , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria .",N
5,382,I have finished . We can go now .,N
6,382,Let's go then . On the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction .,N
7,382,"Let's stop at the newsagent , I would like to buy a newspaper . We can also buy postcards for your friends .",Y
8,382,Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ?,N
9,382,"Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket .",N
10,382,Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office . __eou__,N
0,383,I need some flowers for my girlfriend .,N
1,383,No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?,N
2,383,"Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion .",N
3,383,How much did you want to spend ?,N
4,383,Money is no object .,N
5,383,Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .,Y
6,383,I will take ten .,N
7,383,Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now .,Y
8,383,Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?,N
9,383,"Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .",N
10,383,That's ok . Here is the address . __eou__,N
0,384,What can I do for you ?,N
1,384,Can I have a look at your handworks ?,Y
2,384,"All right . This way , please .",N
3,384,"You have quite a range , haven't you ?",Y
4,384,"Yes , sir .",N
5,384,"They are all produced in China , aren't they ?",N
6,384,"Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese .",N
7,384,Could you please select me one ?,N
8,384,How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful .,N
9,384,"Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ?",N

11,384,OK . I'll take it . __eou__,N
0,385,"Dad , do you know where Mom is ?",N
1,385,I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you .,N
2,385,She'd better not start crying like she usually does .,N
3,385,"I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ?",N
4,385,"Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me .",N
5,385,I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world .,N

0,386,"Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it !",N

3,386,Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .,Y
4,386,"Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom .",N
5,386,But what are you going to do with that pig ?,Y
6,386,I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money .,Y
7,386,"Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation ! __eou__",Y
0,387,Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets .,N
1,387,It still feels really strange to me .,N
2,387,I know . I miss him terribly .,N
3,387,How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ?,N
4,387,I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury .,Y
5,387,I guess you could choose that if you wanted .,Y
6,387,"No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did .",N
7,387,Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! __eou__,N
0,388,Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ?,N

6,388,How about its quality ?,N
7,388,You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum .,Y
8,388,"OK , what is this ?",N
9,388,It is feeding-bottle as the free gift .,Y
10,388,It is thoughtful . I will take it . __eou__,N
0,389,We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food .,Y
1,389,"Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill .",Y
2,389,What should we buy ?,N
3,389,Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first .,Y
4,389,It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top .,N
5,389,How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it .,Y
6,389,Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children .,Y
7,389,"Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ?",Y
8,389,That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks .,Y

3,391,Thanks for noticing .,N
4,391,What type of diet were you on ?,N
5,391,"I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .",Y
6,391,That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?,N
7,391,"Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .",Y
8,391,"That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?",N
9,391,"Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .",Y
10,391,That makes sense . I'm going to try that .,N
11,391,You don't need to lose weight .,N
12,391,I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of .,N
13,391,Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .,Y

0,394,Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ?,N
1,394,I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely .,Y
2,394,He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .,N
3,394,"Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him .",Y
4,394,How do you propose to help him understand that ?,Y
5,394,"Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends .",Y
6,394,I guess we could go visit once in a while too .,Y
7,394,Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . __eou__,Y
0,395,Oops !,N
1,395,What happened ?,N
2,395,I overcooked the corn .,N
3,395,That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . __eou__,N
0,396,"I'm freezing . Turn down the air conditioner , will you ?",N
1,396,But then it'll be too warm .,N

3,397,That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more .,N
4,397,He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .,N
5,397,"Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake .",Y
6,397,"You're glad he saved me , huh ?",N
7,397,Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! __eou__,N
0,398,Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .,N
1,398,"Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet .",Y
2,398,Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight .,N
3,398,"That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem .",N
4,398,What do you know ? You are over weight too .,N
5,398,I'm not on a diet though .,N
6,398,"I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight .",Y
7,398,I like ice cream too much though .,N
8,398,C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .,Y
9,398,It does sound appealing .,N
10,398,It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .,Y
11,398,Okay . I'm in . Let's do it .,N
12,398,Great . I'll get our plan started right away .,Y
13,398,Can we start tomorrow though ? __eou__,N

4,399,"Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ?",N
5,399,"Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo .",N
6,399,It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here .,N
7,399,Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo .,Y
8,399,Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos .,N
9,399,OK . It's 22 yuan,N
10,399,Here you are . __eou__,N

7,401,Do you have a warranty on it ?,N
8,401,Of course . The warranty period is one year .,N
9,401,"If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ?",Y

5,404,That takes some time .,N
6,404,I took the dog for a walk .,N
7,404,I'll bet he enjoyed his walk .,N
8,404,I vacuumed the entire house .,N
9,404,That's a lot of work .,N

3,407,You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours .,Y

6,614,"You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour .",Y

5,621,Channel 8 .,N
6,621,It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? __eou__,N
0,622,I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls .,Y
1,622,"Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor .",N
2,622,"Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor .",Y
3,622,Are you sure ?,N
4,622,"Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful .",N
5,622,Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ?,Y
6,622,Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up .,N
7,622,"Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ?",Y
8,622,Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right .,Y
9,622,"And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in .",Y
10,622,"Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . __eou__",Y
0,623,"Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ?",N
1,623,Yes . May I help you ?,N

3,623,"Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ?",N
4,623,Let me see . It seems a little late .,N

1,625,I agree . And it's very convenient .,N
2,625,Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail .,Y

2,626,Are you good at cooking ?,N
3,626,"I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !",Y
4,626,It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !,Y
5,626,I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?,Y
6,626,"Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .",N
7,626,That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .,N
8,626,I have the same idea as yours .,N
9,626,It's OK . Please have a taste of it .,N
10,626,"Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .",N

17,626,It's my pleasure . __eou__,N
0,627,"Alright , tell me what you think about this one .",Y
1,627,Don't you think it's a bit bright ?,N
2,627,"Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?",Y
3,627,"That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?",N
4,627,"No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .",Y
5,627,"I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .",Y
6,627,"How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?",Y
7,627,That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?,Y
8,627,That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .,Y
9,627,"Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",N
10,627,Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?,N
11,627,That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?,N
12,627,"The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . __eou__",Y
0,628,Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down .,N
1,628,"I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you .",N
2,628,"That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ?",N
3,628,"No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . __eou__",N
0,629,"Boy , come here !",N
1,629,"Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ?",N
2,629,"Bring me a cup of coffee , please .",N
3,629,Will you have it strong or weak ?,N
4,629,I prefer strong . __eou__,N
0,630,Won't you have some of this ?,N
1,630,"Yes , thanks .",N
2,630,It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .,N
3,630,It's very good . How do you make it ?,N
4,630,I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .,Y
5,630,This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .,N

7,630,You Americans usually have nutritious food .,N
8,630,"Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?",Y
9,630,We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .,Y
10,630,I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . __eou__,Y
0,631,"Here , Let me get the door for you .",N
1,631,Thanks .,N
2,631,Do you need a hand with that ?,N

0,632,"Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school .",N
1,632,Is he doing very well at school ?,N
2,632,"He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies .",N
3,632,What's his problem ?,N
4,632,This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem .,Y
5,632,How can his he do that ?,N
6,632,"There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . __eou__",Y
0,633,Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .,Y
1,633,"What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .",Y
2,633,But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .,N
3,633,"Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . __eou__",Y
0,634,There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ?,N
1,634,"I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper .",Y
2,634,What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?,N
3,634,I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market .,Y
4,634,I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . __eou__,Y
0,635,"Good morning , Mrs . Smith .",N
1,635,"Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .",N
2,635,What kind of books does she like ?,N
3,635,She's very fond of detective stories . __eou__,N
0,636,Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?,N
1,636,"Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .",N
2,636,Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .,N
3,636,"I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .",N
4,636,Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?,N
5,636,Nothing .,N
6,636,What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .,N
7,636,Promise that you won't get angry .,N
8,636,"OK , I promise . What is it ?",N
9,636,It's a kitty .,N

12,636,No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .,N
13,636,"Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .",N

15,636,"I will . Thank you , Mummy . __eou__",N
0,637,There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide .,Y
1,637,You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds .,Y
2,637,"But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it .",Y
3,637,"To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . __eou__",Y
0,638,"Hello , do you have any vacancies ?",N

0,639,What kind of films do you like best ?,N
1,639,I like feature films best . How about you ?,Y
2,639,I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ?,N
3,639,"I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot .",Y

3,644,Is there any furniture in it ?,N
4,644,"Yes , it's fully furnished .",N
5,644,What's the rent for a year ?,N
6,644,"15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas .",N
7,644,Where is it located ?,N
8,644,It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station .,N
9,644,"That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ?",Y
10,644,The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ?,Y

1,645,Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ?,N
2,645,"Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment .",Y
3,645,OK . Would you like to live in a studio ?,N
4,645,"Sure , a studio would be fine . __eou__",Y
0,646,"Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?",Y
1,646,Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?,N
2,646,"Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .",N
3,646,"That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?",N
4,646,It says it's located in the suburbs . __eou__,N
0,647,"Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ?",Y
1,647,"Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too .",Y
2,647,Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ?,N
3,647,"Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . __eou__",Y
0,648,"It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown .",Y
1,648,OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .,Y
2,648,"I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?",N
3,648,"Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .",Y
4,648,"Oh , great idea ! __eou__",Y
0,649,"Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro .",Y
1,649,"Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ?",N
2,649,"It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month .",Y
3,649,That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well .,Y
4,649,That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . __eou__,N
0,650,I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised .,N

3,650,No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .,Y
4,650,"I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .",Y
5,650,"Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there .",Y
6,650,Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ?,N
7,650,Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place .,N

8,654,"Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . __eou__",Y
0,655,Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room .,Y

5,656,"It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references .",N
6,656,What kind of references do you need ?,N
7,656,Perhaps your employer could supply us with one .,Y

7,676,I want egg soup .,N
8,676,Have you decided on anything ?,N
9,676,I'd like to have some meat .,N
10,676,How about stewed-fried steamed pork ?,Y
11,676,"No , thank you .",N

1,677,What's the matter with it ?,N
2,677,I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here .,Y
3,677,How about the tires ?,Y
4,677,Nothing serious . The right one needs some air . __eou__,Y
0,678,"Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ?",N
1,678,"Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner .",N

3,678,It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights .,N
4,678,OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ?,N

0,679,"Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ?",N
1,679,"No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man .",N
2,679,I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald .,N
3,679,That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . __eou__,N
0,680,May I take your order now ?,N
1,680,"Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ?",Y
2,680,Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' .,Y
3,680,The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ?,N
4,680,"Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .",N
5,680,"Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar .",N
6,680,"Then , how about this one ?",Y
7,680,OK . I'll have that .,N
8,680,Very good . Could I serve you anything else ?,N
9,680,Thank you . That's enough .,N
10,680,"My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch .",N
11,680,Thanks . __eou__,N
0,681,Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 .,N
1,681,I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 .,N
2,681,So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you .,N
3,681,Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ?,Y
4,681,"Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us .",N
5,681,So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 .,N
6,681,And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 .,N
7,681,And is that all ?,N
8,681,"Yes , this is everything on the list .",N
9,681,So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ?,N
10,681,"Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ?",N
11,681,I think £ 5 would be good . __eou__,N
0,682,Good evening .,N
1,682,Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim .,N
2,682,"Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim .",N
3,682,But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon .,Y
4,682,"It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?",Y
5,682,"Well , it's a window table that we've booked .",N
6,682,"I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats .",N
7,682,"Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one .",Y
8,682,"Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim .",N
9,682,"If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here .",Y
10,682,"Yes , I will . __eou__",N
0,683,I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .,Y
1,683,We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .,Y
2,683,"I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .",N
3,683,We need to find a good realtor .,N
4,683,"Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .",N
5,683,What do you mean ?,N
6,683,"Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .",N
7,683,But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .,N
8,683,"Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .",N
9,683,"I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .",Y
10,683,"Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .",Y
11,683,So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?,Y
12,683,It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .,Y
13,683,And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?,N
14,683,"Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .",Y
15,683,Why ?,N
16,683,"That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .",Y
17,683,Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .,N
18,683,It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .,N
19,683,I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .,Y
20,683,All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . __eou__,N
0,684,"Where to , madam ?",N
1,684,"Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train .",N
2,684,I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam .,N
3,684,Here is the Grand Central Station .,N
4,684,Thank you . How much is the fare ?,N
5,684,The meter reads 9.15 dollars .,N
6,684,Here you are . Keep the change .,N
7,684,Thank you . __eou__,N
0,685,"Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant .",N
1,685,Thank you .,N
2,685,Do you have a reservation ?,N
3,685,"Yes , I do .",N
4,685,"May I have your name , please ?",N
5,685,"Yes , it's Mr . Brown .",N
6,685,"Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ?",N
7,685,"Oh , this is just fine .",N
8,685,Please take a seat .,N
9,685,Thank you .,N
10,685,Here is the menu . __eou__,N
0,686,Would you like to have a piece of cake ?,N
1,686,"No , thank you . I'm on a diet .",N
2,686,Why ? You're not fat .,N
3,686,"I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure .",Y
4,686,Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident .,Y
5,686,I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only .,N
6,686,Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties .,Y
7,686,How much do they weigh ?,N
8,686,All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg .,N
9,686,But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . __eou__,N
0,687,Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ?,N
1,687,Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it .,N
2,687,How long will it take me to get there ?,N
3,687,It's only about a five-minute walk .,N
4,687,Thank you very much .,N
5,687,You're welcome . __eou__,N
0,688,"Where to , sir .",N
1,688,"To this place , please .",N
2,688,Star Hotel . OK .,N
3,688,How long does it take to get to the hotel ?,N
4,688,About 20 minutes .,N
5,688,Here's the hotel .,N
6,688,How much is the fare ?,N
7,688,That's 10 dollars . __eou__,N
0,689,"Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton .",N
1,689,Do you know in which area ?,N
2,689,"No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here .",N
3,689,"I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ?",N
4,689,"Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station .",N
5,689,Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station .,N
6,689,Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ?,N
7,689,OK . __eou__,N
0,690,"Hello , are you interested in this Honda ?",N
1,690,"Hi , I am just looking .",N
2,690,It's a good car .,N
3,690,What year is it ?,N
4,690,1999 .,N
5,690,How about the mileage ?,Y
6,690,"6,000 miles , all highway mileage .",N
7,690,What do you mean 7B,N
8,690,Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much .,Y
9,690,"Oh , why such a high mileage ?",N
10,690,The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line .,N
11,690,Okay . Does this car have a warranty ?,N
12,690,One month .,N
13,690,How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ?,N
14,690,You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage .,N
15,690,How much is it ?,N
16,690,"$ 5,900 .",N
17,690,I'll have to think about it .,N
18,690,"Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced .",N
19,690,Okay . __eou__,N
0,691,What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ?,Y
1,691,We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings .,Y
2,691,I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap .,Y
3,691,You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ?,N
4,691,"Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so .",N
5,691,"While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove .",Y
6,691,We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green .,Y
7,691,I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners .,Y
8,691,"Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook .",N
9,691,"No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room .",N
10,691,"Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year .",Y
11,691,And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ?,Y
12,691,Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ?,Y
13,691,Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . __eou__,Y
0,692,"Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month .",N
1,692,"Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ?",N
2,692,"Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ?",N
3,692,Not really .,N
4,692,What did you do for your last move ?,N
5,692,"Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out .",N
6,692,Oh . that's very nice of him .,N
7,692,"Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you .",Y
8,692,"Yes , please . __eou__",N
0,693,"Miss , may I help you ?",N
1,693,"Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different .",N
2,693,It's because of the view .,N
3,693,Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ?,N
4,693,Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms .,Y
5,693,How many elevators are there ?,N
6,693,There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units .,N
7,693,How about the car-park space ?,Y
8,693,"There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents .",N
9,693,Any other facilities ?,N
10,693,"Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only .",Y
11,693,What is the completion date ?,N
12,693,The completion date will be July 1st 2007 .,N
13,693,How about the price and the bank mortgage ?,Y
14,693,"Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers .",N
15,693,How many payment methods are there ?,N
16,693,It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone .,N
17,693,Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help .,N
18,693,You're welcome . __eou__,N
0,694,"You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal .",Y
1,694,"I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it .",N
2,694,"Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves .",N
3,694,That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another . __eou__,Y
0,695,"Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ?",N
1,695,I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there .,N
2,695,How often dose this bus go there ?,N
3,695,Every fifteen minutes .,N
4,695,I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ?,N
5,695,The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it .,N
6,695,Where can I find the bus ?,N
7,695,The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it .,N
8,695,Thanks a lot .,N
9,695,You are welcome . __eou__,N
0,696,"Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? !",N
1,696,I'd like a coffee please .,N
2,696,"Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ?",N
3,696,What have you got ?,N
4,696,"Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano .",Y
5,696,Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please .,N
6,696,Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there . __eou__,N
0,697,"Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate .",Y
1,697,"Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal .",N
2,697,"Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ?",N
3,697,"I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean .",N
4,697,"I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . __eou__",Y
0,698,What is your favorite coffee ?,N
1,698,Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it .,N
2,698,All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?,N
3,698,"Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .",N
4,698,"I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .",Y
5,698,Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world .,N
6,698,"I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?",N
7,698,"Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .",Y
8,698,"No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays .",N
9,698,I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . __eou__,Y
0,699,"Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ?",N

5,699,Have you got small change ? They require exact fare .,N
6,699,"Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ?",N
7,699,"One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box .",Y
8,699,I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ?,N
9,699,"It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus . __eou__",N
0,700,May I know where you are going ?,N
1,700,Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .,N
2,700,I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .,N
3,700,Oh no ! What shall I do ?,N
4,700,Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .,N
5,700,Thank you very much .,N
6,700,My pleasure . __eou__,N
0,701,Here we are on the train .,N

2,701,I hear many people have cars .,N
3,701,"Yes , almost all the families have their own cars .",N
4,701,Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ?,N
5,701,"Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown .",Y
6,701,I see . __eou__,Y
0,702,"Good coming , sir .",N
1,702,Good morning .,N

0,703,How much is the fare ?,N
1,703,Three yuan .,N
2,703,Could you tell me how to use it ?,Y
3,703,You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .,N
4,703,"Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ?",N
5,703,That's very easy . The exit is always open .,N
6,703,Thank you for your help .,N

4,934,Do you do the same exercises every day ?,N
5,934,"No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .",Y
6,934,Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?,N
7,934,"It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .",Y
8,934,"Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . __eou__",Y
0,935,Can I help you ?,N
1,935,"Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .",N
2,935,"Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students .",Y
3,935,I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .,N
4,935,"Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .",Y
5,935,Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?,N
6,935,"Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ?",N
7,935,History .,N
8,935,"Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price .",N
9,935,Thirty percent ?,N
10,935,Yes .,N
11,935,Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?,Y
12,935,Yes . It's an excellent system .,N
13,935,"Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?",N
14,935,"Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing .",N
15,935,I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .,N
16,935,"I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .",N
17,935,What ? Are you serious ?,N
18,935,Yes .,N
19,935,But nobody uses Macintosh !,N
20,935,"That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ?",Y
21,935,"Yes , I'm from Taiwan .",N
22,935,"Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .",Y
23,935,But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .,Y
24,935,There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple .,Y
25,935,Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .,Y
26,935,"No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple .",N
27,935,"Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .",N
28,935,"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__",N
0,936,Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright .,Y
1,936,"Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you .",Y
2,936,... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs .,N
3,936,That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there .,Y
4,936,Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ... __eou__,Y
0,937,What would you like for your main dish ?,N
1,937,"Steak , please .",N
2,937,How would you like it ?,N

0,939,How about going swimming ?,Y
1,939,OK . Where should we go ?,Y
2,939,Why don't we go down to the pool ? It's not too far from here .,Y
3,939,Fine . I'll be ready in a minute . __eou__,N
0,940,"Hello , this is Sheila from Huawei Corp . Is that Li Lei ?",N
1,940,"Yes , speaking .",N

4,943,I'll take it . __eou__,N
0,944,"Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ?",N
1,944,The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction .,N
2,944,"Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east .",N
3,944,"No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left .",N
4,944,"Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ?",N
5,944,"Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ?",Y
6,944,"Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there ! __eou__",N

0,950,"I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe .",Y
1,950,"Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully .",Y
2,950,"Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield .",Y
3,950,"The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . __eou__",Y

4,953,"Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ?",Y
5,953,"Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight .",Y

0,1010,"In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .",Y
1,1010,"You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .",Y
2,1010,Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .,Y
3,1010,"A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . """,","

4,1240,Does that make any difference ?,N

6,1240,Are they designed differently ?,N
7,1240,"A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__",Y
0,1241,This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here .,N
1,1241,"Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store .",N
2,1241,What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ?,N
3,1241,Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too .,Y
4,1241,Faulty products ?,N
5,1241,"Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it .",Y
6,1241,"Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal .",N
7,1241,Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way .,Y

3,1242,"Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best .",N
4,1242,What style of swimming do you like best ?,N
5,1242,"I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired .",N
6,1242,I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn .,N
7,1242,"I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ?",N

0,1261,"Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles .",Y
1,1261,"You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport .",N
2,1261,What do you think might be the source of its popularity ?,Y
3,1261,"I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ...",Y
4,1261,And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks .,Y
5,1261,"Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket .",Y
6,1261,"Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport",Y
7,1261,"Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it .",Y
8,1261,I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong .,N
9,1261,"Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign .",Y
10,1261,"I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? __eou__",Y
0,1262,How do you feel ?,N
1,1262,I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .,N
2,1262,Here is the bigger size .,Y
3,1262,"This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ? __eou__",Y
0,1263,"Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ?",N
1,1263,Give me a shot of whisky and soda .,N
2,1263,"With or without ice , sir ?",N
3,1263,Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste .,Y
4,1263,"Would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( Pouring soda )",Y
5,1263,"Whoa , when .",N
6,1263,"Enjoy your drink , sir . __eou__",N
0,1264,She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog .,N
1,1264,"Cats chase mice , don't they ?",N
2,1264,And bugs . They can catch anything .,Y
3,1264,Do you have to walk a cat ?,N
4,1264,"No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart .",N
5,1264,But then you have to change the litter box .,Y
6,1264,It's better than picking up dog poop . __eou__,N
0,1265,"Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ?",N
1,1265,"Yes . I'm going to stay with the same , a beer .",N

0,1266,"I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet .",N
1,1266,"You are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy .",N
2,1266,"You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat .",N
3,1266,More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down .,Y
4,1266,You said it . __eou__,N
0,1267,Hi . Can I help you ?,N

0,1269,"Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ?",N
1,1269,Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi !,N
2,1269,"Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that .",N
3,1269,I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ?,N
4,1269,"Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you .",Y
5,1269,"So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ?",N
6,1269,"To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time .",N
7,1269,Like this ?,N
8,1269,"Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist .",Y
9,1269,Did I do it right ?,N
10,1269,No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing .,N
11,1269,What should I do with my legs then ?,N
12,1269,"Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another .",Y
13,1269,"Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ?",Y
14,1269,Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . __eou__,Y
0,1270,"Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ?",N
1,1270,Sure . It's down this street on the left .,N
2,1270,Is it far from here ?,N
3,1270,"No , it's not far .",N
4,1270,How far is it ?,N
5,1270,About a mile and a half .,N
6,1270,How long does it take to get there ?,N
7,1270,5 minutes or so .,N
8,1270,Is it close to the subway station ?,N

10,1270,Thanks a lot . __eou__,N
0,1271,"Excuse me , driver . Does this bus go to the museum ?",N

2,1271,How long is the ride ?,N
3,1271,"Well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy .",N
4,1271,Thank you.How much is the fare ?,N
5,1271,"Drop 50 cents in the box , please .",N
6,1271,Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I am a stranger here .,N

4,1272,Thank you very much . __eou__,N
0,1273,"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ?",N
1,1273,"I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life .",Y
2,1273,"You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art .",Y
3,1273,"An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating .",Y
4,1273,Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ?,Y
5,1273,I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels .,N
6,1273,"All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life .",Y
7,1273,I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements .,Y
8,1273,"Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life .",Y
9,1273,"So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ?",Y
10,1273,"Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__",N
0,1274,"Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ?",Y
1,1274,"Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do .",Y
2,1274,Are you sure ?,N
3,1274,Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body .,Y
4,1274,Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ?,Y
5,1274,It could also help you increase vital capacity .,Y
6,1274,"That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight .",Y
7,1274,You will make it if you persist in it . __eou__,N
0,1275,"Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ?",Y
1,1275,"I'm not sure if I can , but I'll try . __eou__",Y

1,1276,I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ?,Y
2,1276,Would you like to have a perm ?,N
3,1276,Do you think it will suit me ?,N
4,1276,"Oh , absolutely .",Y
5,1276,"Ok , I'll have it for a change . __eou__",Y
0,1277,Would you do me a favor ?,N
1,1277,I'd be glad to . What is it ? __eou__,Y

1,1278,Hi . I ’ m Tom Peterson . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment .,N
2,1278,"Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have .",Y
3,1278,That ’ s fine .,N
4,1278,What price range are you interested in ?,N
5,1278,"Well , between $ 350-400 a month .",N
6,1278,Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ?,N
7,1278,"I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line .",Y
8,1278,When would you like to move in ?,N
9,1278,As soon as possible .,N
10,1278,How about the end of this month ?,Y
11,1278,Fine .,N
12,1278,"Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ?",Y
13,1278,I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning .,Y
14,1278,Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences .,N
15,1278,Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ?,N

17,1278,That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it . __eou__,N
0,1279,Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?,N
1,1279,"We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .",N
2,1279,Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?,N
3,1279,Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . __eou__,N
0,1280,"Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ?",N
1,1280,You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service .,Y
2,1280,Do you charge for delivery ?,N
3,1280,Wo will deliver the goods to you for free .,N
4,1280,Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ?,N
5,1280,Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number .,N
6,1280,OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ?,N
7,1280,No later than tomorrow .,N
8,1280,Thanks . __eou__,N
0,1281,"Hi , I'd like to have a beer .",N
1,1281,"Hi , good evening . Which kind of beer would you like ?",N
2,1281,I'd like to try a local beer . What would you suggest ?,Y
3,1281,How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here .,Y
4,1281,Sounds good . I'll take that . __eou__,N
0,1282,"Good evening , sir .",N
1,1282,Good evening . I'll have a Scotch .,N
2,1282,"Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ?",N
3,1282,"On the rocks , please . __eou__",N

1,1284,"Boy , you are lost . It's across town .",N
2,1284,Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ?,N
3,1284,You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . __eou__,N
0,1285,What do you think about all the different diets people go on ?,Y
1,1285,I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !,Y
2,1285,But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?,Y
3,1285,"They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .",Y
4,1285,So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?,N
5,1285,"Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .",Y
6,1285,How about drinking soda ?,Y
7,1285,"Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke .",Y
8,1285,That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ?,N
9,1285,"My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .",Y
10,1285,How do you know so much about food and dieting ?,N
11,1285,"You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! __eou__",Y
0,1286,"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .",N
1,1286,"I said , "" Do you want me to help you ? """,N
2,1286,"If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help .",Y
3,1286,OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ? __eou__,N
0,1287,"Hi , Mark .",N
1,1287,"Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .",N
2,1287,All right .,N
3,1287,"So , what do we do now ?",N
4,1287,This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .,N
5,1287,"Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .",N
6,1287,"Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .",N
7,1287,Can I pay you by check ?,N
8,1287,Sure . A check will be fine .,N
9,1287,Is there a laundry room in the basement ?,N
10,1287,Yes .,N
11,1287,Can I sign the lease right now ? __eou__,N
0,1288,"Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?",N
1,1288,I am wondering if you do facial care ?,Y
2,1288,"Yes , we do .",N
3,1288,How much would it be ?,N
4,1288,From 200 to 800 .,N
5,1288,I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?,N
6,1288,No problem . __eou__,N
0,1289,"I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .",N
1,1289,"I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '",N
2,1289,I'm trying to find a post office .,N
3,1289,Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .,N
4,1289,Should I take the bus ?,N
5,1289,No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .,N
6,1289,Thank you very much .,N
7,1289,Anytime . __eou__,N
0,1290,"Hello , Steven . Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel , haven ’ t you ?",N
1,1290,"That ’ s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner .",N

4,1290,You two are always quarrelling over little things .,N
5,1290,"That wasn ’ t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode !",N
6,1290,Are you still mad at her now ?,N
7,1290,"To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done .",N
8,1290,Will you apologize to her ?,N
9,1290,No way . It ’ s her who should apologize . __eou__,N
0,1291,"Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me .",N
1,1291,"I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day .",N
2,1291,It does ’ t matter . I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired .,N
3,1291,Thanks for your understanding .,N
4,1291,You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . __eou__,N
0,1292,"Hi , I ’ m the superintendent of this building . What can I do for you ?",Y

3,1408,"I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special .",Y
4,1408,"Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice .",Y

0,1425,I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game !,Y
1,1425,"Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me !",N
2,1425,"At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go .",Y
3,1425,"I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ?",N
4,1425,"Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .",Y
5,1425,I know it is quite different from Western chess .,Y
6,1425,"Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .",Y
7,1425,But isn't it the same with wiki ?,N
8,1425,"Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__",Y

0,1428,Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic !,N
1,1428,"If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy !",N

5,1429,"Well , sounds very attractive . I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious .",N
6,1429,"Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it .",Y
7,1429,"OK , I think I know what to order for my lunch now . But , eating too much fried food really makes me fat .",N
8,1429,"Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you .",N

0,1431,I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ?,N
1,1431,"For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese .",Y
2,1431,"I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders .",Y
3,1431,"Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance .",Y
4,1431,"Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable .",Y
5,1431,"Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China .",Y
6,1431,"There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess .",Y
7,1431,"You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ?",Y
8,1431,"Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . __eou__",Y

3,1432,"Hey , what's wrong with the TV ?",N
4,1432,I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube .,N

5,1440,"Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to .",Y

6,1445,"Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow !",Y
7,1445,Anything strange about that ?,N
8,1445,"Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .",Y

1,1474,What did they say ?,N
2,1474,They said I need a new hard drive .,N
3,1474,That's too bad . How much is a new one ?,N
4,1474,"It's not too much , only about $ 85 .",N
5,1474,Plus installation ?,N
6,1474,"No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .",N
7,1474,Really ?,N
8,1474,"Yes , it's just a couple of screws .",N
9,1474,That's nice .,N
10,1474,It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .,N
11,1474,"If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you . __eou__",Y
0,1475,I'm going to take a nap .,N
1,1475,You should unplug the phone .,N
2,1475,That's a good idea .,N
3,1475,Do you want me to wake you in an hour ?,N
4,1475,"No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up .",N
5,1475,I'll start dinner at 6:00 .,N
6,1475,Okay . I think I'll be awake by then .,N
7,1475,"If not , your nose will wake you up .",Y
8,1475,You mean I will smell the food cooking ?,Y
9,1475,You might even dream about dinner .,Y
10,1475,I don't think I'm going to dream about anything . I'm really tired .,N

0,1476,Something's wrong with my computer .,N
1,1476,Exactly what ?,N
2,1476,All I get is a black screen .,N
3,1476,What's the matter ?,N
4,1476,"I think I know , because this happened before .",Y
5,1476,What happened before ?,N
6,1476,My hard drive crashed .,N

1,1477,I'm not sure . What's the difference ?,N
2,1477,"Well , what do you plan to use your computer for ?",Y
3,1477,Mostly just to browse the Internet and send emails to friends .,N
4,1477,"Then a PC should be enough . Macintoshes are better for graphics , but they also cost a bit more . __eou__",Y
0,1478,Welcome to Game World . What can I do for you ?,N
1,1478,I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ?,N
2,1478,Sure . This one here just came out . It's got great 3D graphics and a cool story line . It's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the Internet .,Y
3,1478,"This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ?",Y
4,1478,This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular .,Y
5,1478,"Hmm , it's a tough choice , but I think I'll go with this one . __eou__",N
0,1479,I think I'll get some new goggles .,Y
1,1479,"Good idea . I'll get some , too .",Y
2,1479,We also need some sunscreen . What about beach towels ?,Y
3,1479,Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays .,Y
4,1479,"I think I'll get a hat , too .",N
5,1479,"No hat for me , but I'm getting this cool pair of shades .",N
6,1479,"Okay , I guess that's it . Let's go pay for this stuff . __eou__",N
0,1480,What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?,N
1,1480,"We usually eat chicken , pork and beef . You eat these meats a lot in your country too , don't you ?",N
2,1480,"Yes , we do . We also eat mutton .",N
3,1480,I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops .,N
4,1480,That's right . Mutton chops taste so good . We eat them with sauce . Have you ever tried ?,N
5,1480,"Yes , I have . I tried once when I visited your country last year . I think they were very tasty . Can you cook them ?",N
6,1480,Certainly I can . I'll buy some from the butcher's and cook for you next Sunday .,N
7,1480,That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . __eou__,N
0,1481,So are you going to get a new swimsuit ?,N
1,1481,"Yeah , I think I'll get this one-piece .",N
2,1481,Why don't you get a bikini ?,N
3,1481,I'm too fat for a bikini .,N
4,1481,You aren't fat . I'll bet you'd look great in a bikini . How about this thong bikini ?,N
5,1481,I'll wear that if you'll wear these Speedos .,N
6,1481,"I guess that one-piece isn't too bad , either . ( to be continued ) __eou__",Y
0,1482,"This is a good basic computer package . It's got a good CPU , 256 megabytes of RAM , and a DVD player .",N
1,1482,Does it come with a modem ?,N
2,1482,"Yes , it has a built-in modem . You just plug a phone line into the back of the computer .",N
3,1482,How about the monitor ?,Y
4,1482,"A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . If you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money .",Y
5,1482,"That's okay . A 15 - inch is good enough . All right , I'll take it . __eou__",N
0,1483,Are you ready ?,N

2,1483,Ready for the big switch .,Y
3,1483,What are you talking about ?,N
4,1483,The nation is switching to digital TV .,Y
5,1483,Oh . Of course I'm ready .,N
6,1483,Did you buy the converter ?,N
7,1483,"No , I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV .",N
8,1483,How much was that ?,N
9,1483,It was only about $ 120 for a 13 - inch screen .,N
10,1483,Does it pick up any digital channels ?,N

3,1484,"Well , I do aerobics every day after work . And then I play racquetball .",N
4,1484,"Say , I like racquetball , too .",N
5,1484,"Oh , do you want to play sometime ?",N
6,1484,Uh ... how well do you play ?,N
7,1484,"Pretty well , I guess .",N

9,1484,"No problem , Rod . I won't play too hard . __eou__",N
0,1485,Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it .,N
1,1485,"No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged .",N
2,1485,But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride .,N
3,1485,I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time . __eou__,Y
0,1486,"This is No . 1 bus , bound for Sihun .",N

0,1489,Did you put the blue bin out on the street ?,N
1,1489,"Oh , no . I forgot .",N
2,1489,"Well , you'd better take it out front .",N

4,1489,"It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday , which is tomorrow .",N
5,1489,I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning .,N
6,1489,"Oh , no , you don't .",N
7,1489,What do you mean ?,N
8,1489,Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late .,N
9,1489,Do you think I'll forget to do it ?,N
10,1489,"You'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it .",N
11,1489,"Okay , I'll take it out front right now . __eou__",N
0,1490,"Excuse me . I'm your new neighbor , Jack . I just moved in .",N

3,1490,"Yes , there are some on Pine Street .",N
4,1490,OK . And is there a laundromat near here ?,N
5,1490,"Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center .",N
6,1490,Thank you .,N
7,1490,"By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too .",Y

0,1491,Is this the right bus for San Francisco ?,N
1,1491,"It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine .",N
2,1491,When's the first stop ?,N
3,1491,"About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me .",N
4,1491,Thank you .,N
5,1491,Is it all right to smoke on the bus ?,N
6,1491,"Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed .",Y
7,1491,I see . Thank you . __eou__,N
0,1492,Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ?,Y
1,1492,I only wish it were this time yesterday .,N
2,1492,Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong .,N
3,1492,Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better .,Y
4,1492,I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us .,N
5,1492,Perhaps I'd better ring the police ...,Y
6,1492,Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car . __eou__,N
0,1493,Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on !,N
1,1493,Thank you ! Guess how much it costs .,N
2,1493,"Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess .",Y
3,1493,Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five .,N
4,1493,"Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?",N
5,1493,Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down .,N
6,1493,How much did she ask for ?,N
7,1493,"Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty .",N
8,1493,"She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ?",N
9,1493,"Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head .",N
10,1493,Then you pretended to go without buying it ?,N
11,1493,"Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' __eou__",Y
0,1494,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .,N
1,1494,"cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?",N
2,1494,"yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .",N
3,1494,"is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .",N
4,1494,but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?,N
5,1494,"of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal . __eou__",Y
0,1495,"Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .",N
1,1495,Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .,N
2,1495,"Yes , Mum . __eou__",N
0,1496,Is your father in the habit of having naps ?,N
1,1496,"Yes , all of us have naps .",N
2,1496,Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ?,N
3,1496,"No , not at all . __eou__",N
0,1497,When do you go to bed usually ?,N
1,1497,I go to bed at ten and get up at six .,N
2,1497,That's helpful for your health .,N
3,1497,Sure . __eou__,N
0,1498,"Are you ready , Pa ?",N
1,1498,In a second . Have you got a torch ?,N
2,1498,No .,N
3,1498,Here it is . Let's go . __eou__,N
0,1499,Let's see if we forget anything .,Y
1,1499,"Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area .",Y
2,1499,"Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please .",N
3,1499,All right . __eou__,N
0,1500,Do you like the cookies ?,N
1,1500,I finished them in no time .,N
2,1500,Glad you like it .,N
3,1500,"Mum , when will we have them again ? __eou__",N
0,1501,"I'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?",Y
1,1501,"OK , Mum , when will you be back ?",N
2,1501,I'll be back in ten days . __eou__,N
0,1502,Why is the car before us stopping ?,N
1,1502,What's going on ?,N
2,1502,Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .,N
3,1502,More and more people easily get irritated while driving .,Y
4,1502,Yes . This is what is called road rage . __eou__,N
0,1503,"Good evening , madam . Can I help you ?",N
1,1503,Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday .,N
2,1503,Anything wrong with it ?,N
3,1503,"Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole .",N
4,1503,"Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?",N
5,1503,Here it is .,N
6,1503,"Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .",Y
7,1503,That's very kind of you . Thank you .,N
8,1503,"We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again . __eou__",N
0,1504,Would you like a cigarette ?,N
1,1504,"No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .",N
2,1504,Really ? Why ?,N
3,1504,"Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .",Y
4,1504,I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?,N
5,1504,"That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health .",N
6,1504,Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .,N
7,1504,"But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !",N
8,1504,What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?,N
9,1504,I mean you couldn't give it up ! __eou__,N
0,1505,What's your weight .,N
1,1505,150 pounds .,N
2,1505,"Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat .",N
3,1505,I can't bear eating less . __eou__,N
0,1506,your muscles are a spectacle !,N
1,1506,Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise .,N
2,1506,"By the way , do you work out ?",N
3,1506,"No , but I am starting working out from now on .",N
4,1506,Fine . __eou__,N
0,1507,Are you a wrestler or a boxer ?,N
1,1507,No.Why ?,N
2,1507,Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .,N
3,1507,"Oh , really ? I go to the gym every day . __eou__",N
0,1508,I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks .,N
1,1508,"Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it .",N
2,1508,You've formed a sound habit .,N
3,1508,"I think so , too . __eou__",N
0,1509,"Excuse me , ma'am ?",N
1,1509,Yes . What can I do for you ?,N
2,1509,I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room .,N
3,1509,"Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I'm going there myself . Just follow me . __eou__",N
0,1510,You look fresh recently.How do you make it ?,Y
1,1510,I attend an aerobic class three times a week .,N
2,1510,Aren't you tired ?,N
3,1510,"No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . __eou__",Y
0,1511,"Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ?",N
1,1511,It was okay .,N
2,1511,Would you like a drink ?,N
3,1511,"No thanks , I'm not thirsty .",N
4,1511,Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ?,N
5,1511,Not really .,N
6,1511,Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ?,N
7,1511,Yes I did .,N
8,1511,Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ?,N
9,1511,Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual . __eou__,N
0,1512,I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ?,N
1,1512,We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ?,Y
2,1512,"No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too .",Y
3,1512,"Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer .",Y
4,1512,Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue .,N
5,1512,I'll see you later then .,N
6,1512,Bye ! I'll be back before seven . __eou__,N
0,1513,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .,N
1,1513,Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .,Y
2,1513,"No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .",Y
3,1513,"You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?",Y
4,1513,"Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .",Y
5,1513,Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?,N
6,1513,"Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .",Y
7,1513,Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?,N
8,1513,"Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__",N
0,1514,I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday .,N
1,1514,Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ?,Y
2,1514,"Yes , that would be good !",Y
3,1514,We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ?,Y
4,1514,"If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading .",Y
5,1514,"You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ?",Y
6,1514,"Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are .",Y
7,1514,"Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert .",Y
8,1514,Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now .,Y
9,1514,Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift . __eou__,Y
0,1515,"In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people .",Y
1,1515,"Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off !",Y
2,1515,"Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places .",Y
3,1515,"Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people .",Y
4,1515,"Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas .",Y
5,1515,"What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar .",Y
6,1515,"Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . __eou__",Y
0,1516,Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ?,N
1,1516,I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table .,N
2,1516,"You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China .",Y
3,1516,"I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick .",N
4,1516,"You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends .",Y
5,1516,"A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood .",N
6,1516,"Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .",Y
7,1516,I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__,Y
0,1517,"Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it .",Y
1,1517,"You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea .",Y
2,1517,"So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it .",Y
3,1517,"It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning "" Thanks "" . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup .",Y
4,1517,"So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ?",N
5,1517,"Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal .",Y
6,1517,"What does that imply , then ?",N
7,1517,"More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__",Y
0,1518,I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday .,N
1,1518,We have some fresh red roses .,Y
2,1518,How much are the roses ?,N
3,1518,Twenty dollars per dozen .,N
4,1518,That sounds like a good deal .,N
5,1518,"Yes , that is today's sale price .",N
6,1518,I'll take a dozen .,N
7,1518,Is there anything else you'd like to get ?,N
8,1518,"No , the roses will be fine .",N
9,1518,I'm sure your wife will love them . __eou__,N
0,1519,"Overseas operator , may I help you ?",N
1,1519,Yes . I would like to place a collect call .,N
2,1519,Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?,N
3,1519,Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .,N
4,1519,Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through . __eou__,N
0,1520,What reasons do westerners drink for ?,N
1,1520,"I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine .",Y
2,1520,"I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship .",Y
3,1520,"And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink "" one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste .",Y
4,1520,"Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable .",Y
5,1520,"Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! __eou__",Y
0,1521,Why are there so many people ?,N
1,1521,It seems like a traffic accident .,N
2,1521,Those people are quarrelling . __eou__,N
0,1522,It's raining heavily .,N
1,1522,We have to find a shelter .,Y
2,1522,All right .,N
3,1522,Let's go under the tree .,Y
4,1522,"No , we can't . It's thundering .",N
5,1522,Then let's go to that store . __eou__,N
0,1523,"Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ?",N
1,1523,"It's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria .",N
2,1523,"Cindy , you're so cute .",N
3,1523,"She is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ?",N
4,1523,I have a little white cat .,N
5,1523,"Oh , a cat ? Come on .",N
6,1523,"Yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small .",Y
7,1523,"But I think they're dull , aren't they ?",Y
8,1523,Not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs .,Y
9,1523,"Well , cats are certainly more independent .",Y
10,1523,"Absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago .",N
11,1523,"oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?",N
12,1523,Yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it .,N
13,1523,Poor cat .,N
14,1523,Now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . __eou__,N
0,1524,Traffic rules are different among countries .,Y

0,1525,How can we avoid the jam ?,Y
1,1525,Let's take a roundabout way .,Y

2,1535,Things change every minute .,Y
3,1535,We have too many cars ! __eou__,N
0,1536,How long do I have to wait ?,N
1,1536,Two hours.That area is a little backward .,N
2,1536,I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities .,Y
3,1536,You're right . __eou__,N
0,1537,"Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?",Y
1,1537,You really should go to Rachel's pet store .,N
2,1537,Why ? anything special there ?,N
3,1537,It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .,Y
4,1537,"Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?",N
5,1537,Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .,Y
6,1537,That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .,N
7,1537,Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?,N
8,1537,Why not ? it's so cool .,Y
9,1537,But it will pose a risk to your health .,N
10,1537,Pardon ?,N
11,1537,"I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .",N
12,1537,"Well , I didn't realize that .",Y
13,1537,"I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .",N
14,1537,"Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .",Y
15,1537,"Yes , good luck , Maria . __eou__",N
0,1538,Excuse me . Would you tell me where The People's Park is ?,N

5,1538,"No , you aren't . Just go ahead , please .",N
6,1538,May I take a bus to get there ?,N
7,1538,You can take the No . 22 trolley bus to get there .,N
8,1538,OK . Thank you a lot . __eou__,N
0,1539,What a terrible house !,N
1,1539,"I'm sick of it , too .",N

2,1540,Why don't you do your shopping at home ?,N
3,1540,What do you mean ? I can't understand .,N
4,1540,"I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce .",Y
5,1540,Really ? That's unbelievable . __eou__,N
0,1541,"Oh , here comes a bus !",N

2,1541,How long have you waited ?,N
3,1541,Twenty minutes exactly . __eou__,N
0,1542,I'll be late because I have waited so long !,N
1,1542,Don't worry.The bus will arrive soon .,N

0,1543,"Oh , the bus is gone .",N
1,1543,Pity we didn't catch it .,N

0,1544,Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ?,N
1,1544,"Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted .",N
2,1544,Have you ever seen such a nice house ?,N
3,1544,Not really .,N
4,1544,This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new .,Y
5,1544,It's great ! __eou__,N
0,1545,"I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen .",Y
1,1545,"high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room .",Y
2,1545,"It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood .",N
3,1545,What about the one on the Yellow River Road ?,Y
4,1545,"It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen .",N
5,1545,It's a bit small but looks nice .,N
6,1545,"What's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . __eou__",Y

1,1546,Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent .,N
2,1546,"Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet .",N
3,1546,A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for .,N
4,1546,"Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK .",N
5,1546,That sounds just wonderful to us .,N
6,1546,When do you want to move in ?,N
7,1546,How about this afternoon ?,N
8,1546,Fine . I'll be expecting you around two . __eou__,N
0,1547,"My dear , it's five flights up !",N
1,1547,"That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there .",N
2,1547,We're little further away from the street and traffic noise,Y
3,1547,And there's no one living over us .,N
4,1547,Is the place well-furnished ?,N
5,1547,"Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play .",N
6,1547,What about the kitchen ?,Y
7,1547,"The stove and refrigerator are in good working order ,",N
8,1547,And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires .,N
9,1547,Are the plumbing all right ?,N
10,1547,"The plumbing seems OK , too .",N
11,1547,The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water,N
12,1547,And the sinks don't seem to leak .,N
13,1547,The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again . __eou__,Y
0,1548,"Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ?",N
1,1548,"Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store .",N
2,1548,That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?,Y
3,1548,"Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off .",Y
4,1548,"True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time .",N
5,1548,"Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places .",Y
6,1548,"Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not .",Y
7,1548,That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to .,Y
8,1548,"I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . __eou__",Y
0,1549,I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door .,N
1,1549,"You're so careless , Billy .",N
2,1549,"Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away .",N
3,1549,I've done it for you . __eou__,N
0,1550,"My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?",N
1,1550,An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ?,Y
2,1550,"Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .",Y
3,1550,"Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD .",Y
4,1550,"That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .",N
5,1550,"That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .",Y
6,1550,"Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .",Y
7,1550,That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?,N
8,1550,256MB .,N
9,1550,Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . __eou__,N
0,1551,Can I help you ?,N
1,1551,"Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ?",N

3,1551,"No , thanks . __eou__",N
0,1552,"George , did you remember to buy me the book ?",N
1,1552,"Sorry , darling , I forgot .",N
2,1552,When will you buy it then ?,N
3,1552,I promise you'll have it tomorrow . __eou__,N
0,1553,Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue .,Y
1,1553,It is true . I think we should change some policies .,Y
2,1553,Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts .,Y
3,1553,"Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing .",Y
4,1553,Like you and me ! __eou__,Y
0,1554,"Willy , I don't think we have much butter . Can you buy some ?",N
1,1554,"Sure , Mum.In a minute .",N
2,1554,Here's the money.And get some salt .,N
3,1554,"Yes , Mum . __eou__",N
0,1555,I can't believe that .,N
1,1555,What ?,N
2,1555,I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today .,N
3,1555,Oh . Why did she do that ?,N
4,1555,The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . __eou__,N
0,1556,"Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?",N
1,1556,"No , I'm not clear .",N
2,1556,"we've spent $ 1,000 .",N
3,1556,Don't make a fuss.The price is rising __eou__,N
0,1557,Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ?,N
1,1557,I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades .,Y
2,1557,What do you think is the biggest change ?,Y
3,1557,"Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare .",Y
4,1557,"That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more .",Y
5,1557,Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ?,N
6,1557,I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room .,Y
7,1557,"That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough !",Y
8,1557,How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?,N
9,1557,"Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family .",N
10,1557,I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?,N
11,1557,"They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . __eou__",Y
0,1558,"Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?",N
1,1558,"Well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ?",Y
2,1558,"First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs .",Y
3,1558,How can you get that done ?,N
4,1558,"Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan .",Y
5,1558,What else ?,Y
6,1558,"Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .",Y
7,1558,Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ?,N
8,1558,"That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .",Y
9,1558,Perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first .,Y
10,1558,Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it .,N
11,1558,"OK , I'll take it . __eou__",N
0,1559,"Hey , you look great ! how's everything ?",N
1,1559,"Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .",Y
2,1559,Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .,N
3,1559,It's important to do proper exercises .,N
4,1559,You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .,N
5,1559,"The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .",Y
6,1559,Sounds reasonable .,N
7,1559,We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .,Y
8,1559,And fruits !,Y
9,1559,Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .,Y
10,1559,I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?,N
11,1559,"Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .",Y
12,1559,"I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .",N
13,1559,You bet it ! __eou__,N
0,1560,"Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?",N
1,1560,"Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .",Y
2,1560,Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .,Y
3,1560,"I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !",N
4,1560,Really ? What's the series about ?,N
5,1560,"Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .",Y
6,1560,"It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .",N
7,1560,"I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .",Y
8,1560,Really ? that's interesting !,N
9,1560,"Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .",Y
10,1560,"OK , I'll give it a go . __eou__",Y
0,1561,Have you ever tried shopping online ?,Y
1,1561,"No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .",N
2,1561,That's right . Seeing is believing .,N
3,1561,"I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .",Y
4,1561,"That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .",Y
5,1561,"What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .",Y
6,1561,"It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .",Y
7,1561,I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .,N
8,1561,"Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .",Y
9,1561,That's a good idea . __eou__,N
0,1562,Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !,N
1,1562,"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .",N
2,1562,"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .",Y
3,1562,"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .",Y
4,1562,Me too .,N
5,1562,"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .",N
6,1562,"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?",Y
7,1562,"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .",Y
8,1562,"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .",N
9,1562,And the host announced that he won it all ! __eou__,N
0,1563,Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ?,N
1,1563,"Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences .",Y
2,1563,"Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society .",Y
3,1563,That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes .,Y
4,1563,But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year .,Y
5,1563,"Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal .",Y
6,1563,No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite .,Y
7,1563,And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' .,Y
8,1563,The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' .,Y
9,1563,I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . __eou__,Y
0,1564,Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ?,N
1,1564,I bought it online .,N
2,1564,Really ? Do you often shop online ?,N
3,1564,Yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online .,N
4,1564,I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?,N
5,1564,"Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home .",Y
6,1564,"Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier .",N
7,1564,And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall .,Y
8,1564,"Well , are there any other advantages ?",Y
9,1564,"Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere .",Y
10,1564,Are there many choices of online shopping ?,N
11,1564,Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of .,N
12,1564,Perhaps I should have a try . __eou__,Y

2,1570,"Oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? It's already past 10 .",N
3,1570,"But I'm not sleepy , darling . I want to finish it today .",N
4,1570,Okay . Please close the door to the basement before you go to bed . I don't want the dog down there tonight .,N

5,1571,Yes . And there's a walk-in closet .,Y
6,1571,Is there air conditioning ?,N
7,1571,"Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。",N
8,1571,What's the house rent ? When is the rent due ? And how much security deposit do you require ?,N
9,1571,It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . It will be returned to you at the end of your lease .,N

2,1573,I ' m taking some measurements for new curtains .,N
3,1573,"What about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ?",Y
4,1573,I thought we'll just fix up the wood floor.and use some paint for the walls .,Y
5,1573,Good idea . I was thinking the same myself .,Y
6,1573,Tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint . __eou__,Y

7,1575,"I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three .",Y
8,1575,How would you decorate your house ?,Y
9,1575,"I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets .",Y
10,1575,How many TVs would your dream home have ?,N
11,1575,"I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . __eou__",Y
0,1576,We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on .,N
1,1576,Why ?,N

4,1586,"No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated .",Y
5,1586,"I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own .",Y
6,1586,"How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ?",Y
7,1586,That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?,Y

13,1586,"No , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .",N
14,1586,That ’ s even better than the real thing .,Y

5,1592,"Sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too .",Y
6,1592,That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?,N
7,1592,That's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .,Y
8,1592,"Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .",N
9,1592,"You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?",Y
10,1592,I don't think it's broken .,N
11,1592,"Well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages !",Y

3,1594,We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .,Y
4,1594,"That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .",N
5,1594,It can't be that bad .,N
6,1594,"I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .",N
7,1594,"Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .",N
8,1594,"Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better .",N
9,1594,"Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ?",N
10,1594,"When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation .",N
11,1594,Has anything else happened to you ?,N
12,1594,"Nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .",N
13,1594,"Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . __eou__",N
0,1595,"Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ?",N

2,1595,"Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable .",N
3,1595,"Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic .",Y
4,1595,"I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing .",N
5,1595,Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon .,N

6,1596,What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ?,N
7,1596,"I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk .",N
8,1596,Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ?,N
9,1596,I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . __eou__,Y

3,1598,What kind of errands do we need to run ?,N

5,1598,I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight .,N
6,1598,"Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time .",N
7,1598,"Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers .",N
8,1598,I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for .,N

2,1602,How much are you looking to spend ?,N
3,1602,I can only afford about 300 pounds a month .,N
4,1602,Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .,N
5,1602,Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room .,N
6,1602,"Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price !",N

12,1602,Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ?,N
13,1602,"I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished .",Y
14,1602,"You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?",N
15,1602,"No , I thought that would be included in the rent .",N
16,1602,"It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities .",N
17,1602,I don't think I can afford that .,N
18,1602,Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children .,Y
19,1602,That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . __eou__,Y

7,1604,Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones . You can find them on the rack in the basement .,Y

2,1606,What is it like living in on-campus housing ?,N
3,1606,"It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .",N
4,1606,Did you have to pay a deposit ?,N
5,1606,"No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month .",N
6,1606,Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?,N
7,1606,"No , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here .",N
8,1606,How long is your contract for ?,N
9,1606,"That's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon .",N

1,1745,Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ?,Y
2,1745,An acoustic one .,Y
3,1745,Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ?,N
4,1745,What ’ s the difference ?,N
5,1745,"Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking . A steel-string is best for playing chords .",Y
6,1745,I ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar .,N
7,1745,"In that case , I ’ d suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation .",Y
8,1745,"This one ’ s a little too expensive for me . I ’ d prefer something cheaper for now.When I ’ Ve learned to play , I might get a better one .",Y
9,1745,"In that case , how about this one ? It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play .",Y
10,1745,"Hmm.All right , I ’ ll take it , and this book on how to play the guitar as well .",N
11,1745,You should also get a couple of guitar picks .,Y
12,1745,"Oh , right.Thanks for your help .",N

0,1746,Are we here yet ?,N
1,1746,Not quite yet .,N
2,1746,How far away is it ?,N
3,1746,It's still very far away .,N
4,1746,How many miles to go ?,N
5,1746,We're getting close .,N
6,1746,Will we be there soon ?,N
7,1746,Here we are .,N
8,1746,Where's the hotel ?,N
9,1746,It is in front of you .,N
10,1746,I see that . That was a nice ride .,N
11,1746,I'm glad to hear it . __eou__,N
0,1747,"Welcome to Lens Magic , ma ’ am.How can I help you ?",N
1,1747,I ’ d like to buy an inexpensive camera .,N
2,1747,"Well , we ’ Ve got several point-and-shoot cameras.These are all 35mm compact cameras with auto-focus and a built-in flash.We also have these Polaroid cameras .",Y
3,1747,I don ’ t think I ’ ll need a Polaroid.Does this 35mm camera have an automatic flash ?,N
4,1747,"Yes , it does.But you can turn it off if you want .",N
5,1747,"Okay , I ’ ll take this one.Does it come with batteries and a case ?",N
6,1747,"Yes , it does.Here , I ’ ll box it up for you . __eou__",N

1,1748,"Okay , come right this way .",N
2,1748,"( They walk over to the apartment . ) As you can see , it's large and completely furnished .",N
3,1748,What bills are included in the rent ?,N
4,1748,"You have to pay the electricity bill yourself , but water is paid .",N
5,1748,"Well , I guess for $ 400 a month I shouldn't expect an all bills paid apartment . __eou__",Y
0,1749,"Okay , here's the lease . Read it over before you sign it . As you can see , the deposit is $ 300 .",N
1,1749,"Oh , okay . I can get it back when I move out , right ?",N
2,1749,"Yes , assuming there's been no damage to the apartment . Before you move in , you can make a list of any marks , scratches , and so forth that are already there .",N
3,1749,All right . Here's the lease and the check for the deposit .,N
4,1749,Great . You can move in next Monday . Your first month's rent is due then . __eou__,N
0,1750,"The mailboxes are right down there , and the laundry room with coin-operated washers and dryers is over there .",N
1,1750,"I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it .",N
2,1750,"All right , do you want to sign a nine-month or a one-year lease ?",N
3,1750,"I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to summer school . I can extend it if I want to stay , can't I ?",Y
4,1750,Sure . Just let us know before your lease expires . __eou__,N
0,1751,Excuse me . Do you think I can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ?,N
1,1751,"Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . Which do you prefer ?",Y
2,1751,Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ?,N
3,1751,"Generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens .",Y
4,1751,How much more do I have to pay ?,N
5,1751,"Compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 Euro more .",N
6,1751,That's acceptable . No one wants to miss a train .,N
7,1751,OK ... Here we are . We'll turn left at this cross . To go straight ahead is the shortest route .,N
8,1751,Thank you ! __eou__,N
0,1752,"Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus .",N
1,1752,"That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses .",N
2,1752,It was silly of me to have taken a taxi .,N
3,1752,"At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ?",N
4,1752,"No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there .",N
5,1752,"Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year .",Y
6,1752,"The more the world becomes open , the more people become international ! __eou__",Y

0,1754,"How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ?",Y
1,1754,"Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals .",Y
2,1754,I never eat breakfast though .,N
3,1754,"That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food .",Y
4,1754,I never thought about it that way .,Y
5,1754,"I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .",Y
6,1754,"Oh doctor , I feel so foolish .",N
7,1754,Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .,Y
8,1754,"I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__",N

1,1755,The Grand Hotel .,Y

1,1756,I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend .,N
2,1756,don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime .,Y
3,1756,thanks for understanding .,N
4,1756,"well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ?",Y
5,1756,"hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .",Y
6,1756,"Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves .",N
7,1756,"I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .",Y
8,1756,maybe ... I'll think about it .,Y
9,1756,"well , I think you should come and have some fun . Besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . You should at least try . __eou__",Y
0,1757,"Going to the gym tonight , Mary ?",N
1,1757,"Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong .",N
2,1757,That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ?,Y
3,1757,I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend .,Y
4,1757,I'll get my things and meet you there .,N
5,1757,Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__,Y
0,1758,"It's getting late , Mary .",N
1,1758,Maybe I should go home .,Y
2,1758,Why don't you sleep over ?,Y
3,1758,Are you sure ?,N
4,1758,We can sleep together .,N
5,1758,Sounds like a good idea .,Y
6,1758,Don't forget to call your host mother to tell her .,N
7,1758,Thanks for reminding me . __eou__,N
0,1759,"Hello , May I help you ?",N
1,1759,"Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent .",N
2,1759,"Oh , how nice ! There are bright rooms and the house is very quiet .",N
3,1759,That is exactly what we're looking for .,N
4,1759,"Well , each room is 40 dollars a week .",N

1,1760,Haven't been sleeping well recently .,N
2,1760,What's the problem ?,N
3,1760,Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings .,Y
4,1760,"Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .",Y
5,1760,"Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon .",N
6,1760,"I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .",N
7,1760,"Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time . __eou__",Y
0,1761,What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ?,N
1,1761,"Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair .",Y
2,1761,Yes .,N
3,1761,"Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable . __eou__",N

2,1762,150 a month .,N

0,1763,"Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper .",N
1,1763,"He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him .",N

3,1763,Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today .,N
4,1763,Thanks for the warning .,N
5,1763,That's all right . __eou__,N

4,1891,"I know you're right , but what can I do ?",Y

0,1911,"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ”",N
1,1911,"Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite .",Y
2,1911,"I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ?",Y
3,1911,"The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ?",Y
4,1911,"Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits .",should
5,1911,"It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ?",Y

7,2023,I could have Suzy stay at my place .,Y
8,2023,"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",N
9,2023,Why not ?,Y
10,2023,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,Y
11,2023,"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",Y

5,2026,"Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?",Y

8,2026,What do you mean ?,N
9,2026,"We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .",Y
10,2026,I have plenty of gas .,N
11,2026,"Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",N
12,2026,So what can we do ?,Y
13,2026,"Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .",Y
14,2026,Alright . That's a good idea .,Y
15,2026,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .,N

0,2029,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !",N
1,2029,What ? What did you buy ?,N
2,2029,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !,N
3,2029,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?,N
4,2029,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .",N
5,2029,And ?,N
6,2029,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .,N
7,2029,And it's a brick ?,N
8,2029,Yes .,N
9,2029,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,N
10,2029,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .",N
11,2029,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .,N
12,2029,"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .",N
13,2029,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,Y
14,2029,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .,N
15,2029,"Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",N
16,2029,"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .",Y
17,2029,That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,Y
18,2029,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__",N
0,2030,What ? Your diamond ring is lost ?,N

3,2031,"Well , I won ’ t put a crime into their doings . __eou__",N
0,2032,You should not have criticize your son in front of his friends .,N
1,2032,Why ? He did something wrong .,N

3,2052,"Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special .",Y
4,2052,OK . Yeah ! Yeah !,N
5,2052,"First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .",Y
6,2052,"Oh , OK . Wow !",N
7,2052,"OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .",Y
8,2052,Wow . That sounds really good . __eou__,N
0,2053,What're you doing now ?,N
1,2053,I'm watching TV .,N
2,2053,You're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed .,N

0,2055,"Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ?",N
1,2055,"Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?",N
2,2055,"Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .",N
3,2055,And must I go back to school ?,N
4,2055,"No , you needn't do that . You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .",N
5,2055,"But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I'm nearly 17 .",N
6,2055,You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .,N

7,2056,"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",Y
8,2056,"Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !",Y
9,2056,"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",Y
10,2056,"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",Y
11,2056,Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .,N
12,2056,"No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .",N
13,2056,"Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?",N
14,2056,"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !",N
15,2056,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .,N

17,2056,"Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?",N
18,2056,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .,N
19,2056,"Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .",Y
20,2056,There . Stop ! __eou__,N
0,2057,"Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .",N
1,2057,I feel kind of stupid .,N
2,2057,Why ?,N
3,2057,We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .,N
4,2057,You got lost . You're kidding !,N
5,2057,No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .,N
6,2057,You could have called .,Y
7,2057,I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .,Y
8,2057,You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?,N
9,2057,Guess where we ended up .,N
10,2057,I don't know . Where ?,N

12,2057,Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?,N
13,2057,I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .,N
14,2057,Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .,N
15,2057,I know it is . I don't know how it happened .,N
16,2057,"Hmm , maybe I do .",Y
17,2057,What ?,N
18,2057,Maybe I have an idea how it happened .,Y
19,2057,How ?,N
20,2057,"You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .",N
21,2057,"Oh , that's what you think , huh ? __eou__",N
0,2058,Excuse me .,N
1,2058,Yes ? What can I do for you ?,N
2,2058,"I just checked in , and there's a problem with my room .",N
3,2058,And what is the problem ?,N
4,2058,"I asked for a non-smoking room , and I don't have one.My room smells like cigarette smoke . I can't stand it.Could you change my room , please ?",N
5,2058,"Let me see ... I'm sorry , but we don't have any more non-smoking rooms.We won't charge you for your room tonight .",N

2,2059,"So , what are you going to do ?",N
3,2059,"I don't know ... Hey , do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours ?",N
4,2059,"I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon .",N
5,2059,"Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there .",Y

2,2060,Yes . The police have come . __eou__,N
0,2061,How silly of you to jump out of the window !,N
1,2061,But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !,Y
2,2061,Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .,Y
3,2061,That would be too late .,N
4,2061,Maybe the situation is too urgent .,Y
5,2061,"Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . __eou__",N

0,2066,"I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .",N
1,2066,What words ? Can you tell me ?,N
2,2066,"He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .",N
3,2066,"Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .",Y
4,2066,"Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .",N
5,2066,"I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .",Y
6,2066,"It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .",Y
7,2066,"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .",Y
8,2066,"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . __eou__",Y
0,2067,"Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ?",Y
1,2067,I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles .,Y
2,2067,"I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes .",N
3,2067,And what does your husband do ?,N
4,2067,My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now .,Y
5,2067,"But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard .",Y
6,2067,"Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something . __eou__",Y

13,2068,I see . Do you love pets ?,N

9,2070,"Mm , it is .",N
10,2070,Wow . What fillings do you recommend ?,Y
11,2070,"Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese . __eou__",Y

8,2071,"Come on , daddy . You can see that people only pick the red ones .",N

7,2074,OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go .,N

11,2074,"I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one .",N
12,2074,"Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill .",Y
13,2074,"Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ?",Y

4,2152,They must have some special methods to do this during the process .,Y
5,2152,Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities .,N
6,2152,"Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ?",Y
7,2152,Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea .,N
8,2152,What's the advantage about tea ?,Y
9,2152,"There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health .",Y
10,2152,Does that mean the stronger the better ?,N
11,2152,No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong .,N
12,2152,Got it . What's the proper time for tea ?,N
13,2152,It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime .,N

11,2153,Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .,N
12,2153,"I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .",Y
13,2153,You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .,N

6,2154,"Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ?",N

8,2154,Really ? How to do that ?,N
9,2154,"Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction .",Y
10,2154,"That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ?",Y

2,2155,Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it .,N
3,2155,"Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture .",Y
4,2155,Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ?,N
5,2155,Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant .,N
6,2155,"Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ?",N
7,2155,You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now .,N
8,2155,I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ?,N
9,2155,There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget .,N
10,2155,"Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too .",N
11,2155,It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ?,Y
12,2155,I'll take care of the order .,N

4,2156,I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?,Y
5,2156,"Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that .",N
6,2156,It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .,Y
7,2156,"Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?",Y
8,2156,"Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange !",Y
9,2156,"Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne .",Y
10,2156,"Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .",N
11,2156,It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .,Y
12,2156,"That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ?",N
13,2156,"No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft .",N
14,2156,How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .,N
15,2156,I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . __eou__,N

2,2158,"OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned .",Y
3,2158,That's OK . But that must be costly .,N
4,2158,"Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' .",Y
5,2158,"Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer .",N
6,2158,"Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually .",N
7,2158,I see . The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash .,N
8,2158,Never mind . You can leave them to me .,N
9,2158,"Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing .",N
10,2158,"It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know .",N
11,2158,I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ?,N

6,2159,"Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt .",N
7,2159,"It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think .",N
8,2159,"It's been several days now , I am not sure .",N
9,2159,"Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go .",N
10,2159,"Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ?",N
11,2159,I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time .,N

3,2162,Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .,Y
4,2162,See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .,N
5,2162,"Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .",N
6,2162,You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?,Y
7,2162,They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .,N
8,2162,"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?",N
9,2162,Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?,N
10,2162,"Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .",N

7,2163,How much again ?,N

10,2163,"Sorry , sir .",N
11,2163,Why not ?,Y
12,2163,"Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .",N
13,2163,"Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume .",N
14,2163,That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY .,Y
15,2163,DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ?,N

10,2164,He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do .,Y
11,2164,"Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science .",Y
12,2164,"Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic !",N
13,2164,I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world .,Y

5,2165,"Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?",Y
6,2165,"Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings .",Y
7,2165,"Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings .",Y
8,2165,"That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .",Y
9,2165,OK . Anything else ?,N
10,2165,Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on .,N

0,2166,I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done .,N

4,2166,That was last time . This time it's worse .,N
5,2166,"Ok , tell me .",N
6,2166,"Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ...",N
7,2166,And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time .,N
8,2166,"True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ...",N
9,2166,"Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad .",N
10,2166,"And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish .",Y
11,2166,"At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad .",N
12,2166,"Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald .",N
13,2166,"Hmm , that is bad . __eou__",N
0,2167,"Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ?",N

1,2169,"I've got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That's easy , but I have another problem to deal with .",N
2,2169,"What's that ? Don't tell me you've still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours .",N
3,2169,"No , I did that a long time ago . It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus .",N
4,2169,"He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ?",N
5,2169,Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ...,N
6,2169,You think it's better that he should be told ?,Y
7,2169,"Yes , he's too old to believe in that type of things . And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do .",N
8,2169,That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real .,N
9,2169,"I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest , she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son .",N
10,2169,"Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It's hard for kids to find out something like that . __eou__",Y

1,2170,"Oh , you are such a good child today . Come here . Sit next to me .",N

6,2170,Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ?,N

2,2171,"Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .",Y
3,2171,"No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?",Y
4,2171,"Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .",Y
5,2171,Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?,N
6,2171,"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .",N
7,2171,What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .,Y
8,2171,Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . __eou__,Y
0,2172,"Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ?",N

2,2172,"Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn .",N
3,2172,"Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ?",Y
4,2172,I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola .,N
5,2172,"Hey , kid , that's wrong . It's a Chinese restaurant . Let's eat something traditional .",N
6,2172,"Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ?",N
7,2172,"The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ?",Y

0,2175,"Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want .",N
1,2175,You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .,Y
2,2175,Are you serious ? How can that be ?,N
3,2175,"Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .",Y
4,2175,"Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .",N

7,2179,Do you know what's wrong with my PC ?,N
8,2179,"One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software .",N
9,2179,Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ?,N
10,2179,Of course . You'd better learn something about it .,Y
11,2179,I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ?,N

3,2185,"Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ?",Y
4,2185,I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .,N

6,2185,"A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .",Y
7,2185,Was there anyone else with you ?,N
8,2185,"Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .",Y

11,2185,For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?,N
12,2185,"Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .",Y
13,2185,That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .,Y
14,2185,"I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . __eou__",Y

2,2188,"Um , ninety-five dollars ?",N
3,2188,"Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?",N
4,2188,I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .,N
5,2188,"Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?",N
6,2188,"I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . __eou__",N
0,2189,"Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends .",N
1,2189,I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday .,N
2,2189,"They spend hours there , especially on weekends .",N
3,2189,"Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?",Y
4,2189,I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?,Y
5,2189,Isn't that complicated ?,N
6,2189,"No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund .",N
7,2189,We ? Do you want to go with me ?,N
8,2189,Sure . I love going to the mall .,N
9,2189,"What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? __eou__",N
0,2190,"Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?",N
1,2190,"Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .",N
2,2190,"Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .",Y
3,2190,That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .,N
4,2190,"What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?",N
5,2190,"Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .",N
6,2190,"So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?",N
7,2190,"Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .",N
8,2190,"Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .",N
9,2190,"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . __eou__",N
0,2191,"Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ?",N
1,2191,"No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ?",N
2,2191,You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ?,N
3,2191,"No , Officer , not at all .",N
4,2191,Then how can you explain your behavior ?,N
5,2191,"Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer .",N
6,2191,Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ?,N
7,2191,"Um , because I was busy talking to my friend .",N
8,2191,On a cell phone ?,N
9,2191,"Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions .",Y
10,2191,That's definitely true . I'm going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . __eou__,N
0,2192,Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small .,Y
1,2192,I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper .,N
2,2192,A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop .,Y
3,2192,Here ’ s an interesting ad,Y
4,2192,How much is the rent ?,N
5,2192,The ad says $ 325 plus deposit .,N
6,2192,When is the place available ?,N
7,2192,"It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . __eou__",N
0,2193,I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City .,N
1,2193,"Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ?",Y
2,2193,"Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here .",N
3,2193,I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York .,N
4,2193,Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live .,N
5,2193,"Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . __eou__",Y
0,2194,Can you tell me how to reach the bank please ?,N
1,2194,"Which bank ? There are two , the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland .",Y
2,2194,I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank .,N
3,2194,"You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre , Dunned Stores .",N
4,2194,How do I get there . I have no knowledge of this area .,N
5,2194,Cross the road and turn left at the other side . Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left .,Y
6,2194,It sounds very complicated . How far is it from here ?,N
7,2194,It's not so complicated . It's about five minutes walk from here . I can draw a map for you if you wish .,Y
8,2194,"Oh , I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ?",N
9,2194,You will be going northwards . You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East . Here's a rough sketch of the area . __eou__,N
0,2195,What does a housing go for in south mountain district ?,N
1,2195,It depends on the type of the house you're looking for .,N
2,2195,We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home .,N
3,2195,What ’ s your general price range ?,N
4,2195,"Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose .",N
5,2195,"Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest .",Y
6,2195,What about a two-bedroom house ?,Y
7,2195,"A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB .",N
8,2195,I see .,N
9,2195,"I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family .",Y
10,2195,"Okay , I will take it into consideration . __eou__",N
0,2196,"Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?",N
1,2196,I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .,N
2,2196,"Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?",N
3,2196,"Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .",Y
4,2196,So this would be your first automobile ?,N
5,2196,"That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .",N
6,2196,"Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .",Y
7,2196,"Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .",N
8,2196,"So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !",Y
9,2196,"Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .",N
10,2196,Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .,N
11,2196,I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .,N
12,2196,"Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?",N
13,2196,"Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .",N
14,2196,I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . __eou__,N
0,2197,"This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum .",N
1,2197,"Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once .",Y
2,2197,That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ?,N
3,2197,"Certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly .",Y
4,2197,How long will it take ?,N
5,2197,It depends .,N
6,2197,I need to talk it over with my wife .,N
7,2197,Certainly . __eou__,N
0,2198,I heard you are looking for a house .,N
1,2198,Yes .,N
2,2198,How is this going ?,N
3,2198,I haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet .,N
4,2198,I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer .,Y
5,2198,Where is the house ?,N
6,2198,It is on Spring Avenue .,N
7,2198,Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ?,N
8,2198,It ’ s $ 240 a month .,N
9,2198,Does that include utilities ?,N
10,2198,"It includes water , but not gas and electricity .",Y
11,2198,That ’ s a little expensive .,N
12,2198,But it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work .,N
13,2198,Yes . I won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . Is it a one-bedroom apartment ?,N
14,2198,"Yes , it is .",N
15,2198,That is what I am looking for . Could I go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ?,N
16,2198,Certainly ! But I have to contact my friend first .,N
17,2198,All right ! Thank you . __eou__,N
0,2199,Are you looking for an apartment ?,N
1,2199,"Yes , I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square .",N
2,2199,I think I have just a right apartment for you .,N
3,2199,"Oh , good . Can you describe it ?",N
4,2199,"Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens .",N

11,2199,"Ok , that would be great . __eou__",N
0,2200,"Hello , Matt !",N
1,2200,"Hello , Todd !",N
2,2200,"Matt , I'm going to ask you some questions about pet.First question , do you have a pet ?",N
3,2200,"Yes , in fact , my mom's house we have three , three pets . two dogs and a cat . My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people .",Y
4,2200,"Wow , like how do they train the dogs ?",Y
5,2200,"How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school .",Y
6,2200,"Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ?",N
7,2200,"Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training .",Y
8,2200,"Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ?",Y
9,2200,"Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile .",Y
10,2200,"Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ?",Y
11,2200,"I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what .",Y
12,2200,"Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ?",Y
13,2200,"Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they . __eou__",Y
0,2201,"Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving .",N
1,2201,"We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out .",N

0,2203,Is there anything wrong ?,N
1,2203,I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .,N
2,2203,Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .,N
3,2203,I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .,N
4,2203,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .,Y
5,2203,But I just want to give her some tips .,N
6,2203,"Oh , she can make her own decisions .",Y
7,2203,I guess you are right .,N

2,2212,But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .,Y
3,2212,But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .,N

3,2214,"After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it .",Y
4,2214,Which spices are you going to add to the meat ?,N
5,2214,"These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add .",N
6,2214,Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ?,Y
7,2214,"Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan .",Y
8,2214,Right . What are you doing over there ?,N

2,2218,"Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .",N
3,2218,"So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?",N
4,2218,"Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .",Y
5,2218,Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?,N
6,2218,"No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .",N
7,2218,You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . __eou__,Y
0,2219,What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?,N
1,2219,Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .,N
2,2219,It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?,N
3,2219,"I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .",Y
4,2219,"It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?",N
5,2219,"Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large-that ’ s the fashion .",Y
6,2219,"I might get one too , but in a different colour . I prefer light blue to while .",Y
7,2219,"There . It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .",N
8,2219,"I ’ m getting this beret – doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me .",Y
9,2219,Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .,N
10,2219,Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time . __eou__,N
0,2220,Good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company .,N
1,2220,Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down .,N
2,2220,When did it first break down ?,N
3,2220,About ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating .,N
4,2220,"Is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one .",Y
5,2220,"Yes , it ’ s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high-pitch noise when it ’ s in use .",N
6,2220,"Ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes .",N
7,2220,What ’ s wrong with it ?,N
8,2220,Part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily .,Y
9,2220,That ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? __eou__,N
0,2221,"Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?",N
1,2221,Yeah how ’ d you know ?,N

3,2221,Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin .,Y
4,2221,"It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?",Y
5,2221,"Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .",Y
6,2221,In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .,Y
7,2221,Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !,N
8,2221,It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... __eou__,N

1,2222,"Yes , but it's quite a ways .",N
2,2222,Do I need to take a bus ?,N
3,2222,This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes .,Y
4,2222,How do I get there on foot ?,N
5,2222,Go straight ahead through the intersection .,N
6,2222,"Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready .",Y
7,2222,"Keep walking till you pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third .",N
8,2222,Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ?,N
9,2222,Keep walking and look for a tall building .,Y
10,2222,Tall building ... Which side is the building on ?,N
11,2222,The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor .,Y
12,2222,Thank you very much .,N

6,2223,I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !,N

6,2225,Great play !,N
7,2225,"We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone !",N

4,2227,"Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .",Y
5,2227,What about all these other pieces ?,Y
6,2227,"See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it .",Y
7,2227,And these two ? They are husband and wife ?,N

1,2267,"Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .",Y
2,2267,"I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ?",N
3,2267,Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain .,Y
4,2267,I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?,Y
5,2267,Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?,Y
6,2267,It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square metres .,N
7,2267,I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better .,Y
8,2267,Ok . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . __eou__,N
0,2268,I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ?,Y
1,2268,I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ?,N
2,2268,I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .,N
3,2268,New furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table .,Y
4,2268,Do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?,N
5,2268,That wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ?,N
6,2268,Yes . I have some many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore .,Y
7,2268,I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition .,Y
8,2268,"That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy .",Y
9,2268,I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day .,Y
10,2268,Ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes . __eou__,N
0,2269,I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ?,Y
1,2269,"That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room .",N
2,2269,I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe .,Y
3,2269,You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom .,Y
4,2269,"Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though .",Y
5,2269,Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store .,Y
6,2269,Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom .,Y
7,2269,You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work .,Y
8,2269,That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . __eou__,Y
0,2270,Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ?,N

2,2270,"I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds .",Y
3,2270,Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ?,N
4,2270,"We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant .",N
5,2270,"I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often .",N
6,2270,Why is it relatively expensive ?,N
7,2270,Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries .,N
8,2270,"I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country .",Y
9,2270,"We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket .",Y
10,2270,"Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine .",Y
11,2270,A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . __eou__,Y
0,2271,Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time .,N
1,2271,"Ok , what do you want me to do ?",N

3,2271,"Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .",N
4,2271,We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .,Y
5,2271,"While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meal , by the way .",N
6,2271,"Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .",N
7,2271,My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?,N
8,2271,Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .,N
9,2271,Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . __eou__,Y
0,2272,Have you seen Bill recently ?,N
1,2272,"Yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now .",N
2,2272,Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood .,N
3,2272,"You have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from Tom ?",N
4,2272,"He ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold .",N
5,2272,"He might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy .",N
6,2272,"I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow .",N
7,2272,"It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look .",N
8,2272,"Oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling .",N
9,2272,That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand .,N
10,2272,"Yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . __eou__",N
0,2273,"How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?",N
1,2273,It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .,N
2,2273,Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .,N
3,2273,You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .,Y
4,2273,"Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I ?",N
5,2273,"Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .",N
6,2273,"I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?",N
7,2273,That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .,N
8,2273,"These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . __eou__",Y

1,2274,"Certainly . Could you put it on the scales , so I can check the weight ?",N
2,2274,Sure . It ’ s not very heavy .,N
3,2274,That ’ s 850 grams . The coasts depends on how you would like to send it .,N
4,2274,I see . What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail .,Y
5,2274,That ’ s right . Sending it by airmail will cost twelve dollars and sending it by surface mail will cost eight dollars .,N
6,2274,How long will it take to get there ?,N
7,2274,Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks .,Y
8,2274,"It that case , I ’ ll send it by airmail . I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel .",N
9,2274,No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra .,N

15,2275,I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours !,N

17,2275,"Yes , fine . Let me see how much money I have in my wallet .",N
18,2275,... sir ?,N
19,2275,Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet !,N

2,2277,"No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction .",N
3,2277,Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway .,N
4,2277,How far is that ?,N
5,2277,It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south .,N
6,2277,"According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London .",N

10,2277,Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ?,N
11,2277,The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ?,N
12,2277,"22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ?",N
13,2277,It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way .,Y
14,2277,We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . __eou__,Y

4,2296,"No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .",N
5,2296,"But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .",N
6,2296,You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .,N

5,2303,"Well , do you have any suggestions ?",Y
6,2303,Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?,Y
7,2303,"It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .",N
8,2303,"Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .",Y
9,2303,OK .,N
10,2303,"Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? __eou__",N
0,2304,Here's the dress you wanted to be made .,N
1,2304,"Oh , dear !",N
2,2304,What's the matter ?,N
3,2304,It's not what I asked for .,N
4,2304,What's wrong with it ?,N
5,2304,It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it .,N
6,2304,This is a pity ! __eou__,N
0,2305,"So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?",Y
1,2305,"Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .",Y
2,2305,That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .,N
3,2305,Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .,Y
4,2305,Did you buy new cupboards too ?,N
5,2305,"No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .",N
6,2305,I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .,N
7,2305,"Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .",Y
8,2305,"Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food .",Y
9,2305,"Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food .",Y
10,2305,"Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket .",Y
11,2305,I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! __eou__,N
0,2306,Sorry . What was that you said ?,N
1,2306,I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven .,N

3,2306,At the Gate .,N

6,2306,Who's coming ?,N
7,2306,"Peter . Peter Brown , you know . Don't forget to bring the letter .",N
8,2306,Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said . There's a lot of noise outside .,N
9,2306,I told you not to forget to bring the letter .,N
10,2306,"Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . __eou__",N
0,2307,We'd like to rent a flat near the university .,N
1,2307,Are you looking for somewhere for two people ?,N
2,2307,"Yes , we are . Obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month .",Y
3,2307,"Yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . Do you have any other requirements ?",N
4,2307,"Not really , no . We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street .",N
5,2307,How many rooms do you need in the flat ?,N
6,2307,We'll need two bedrooms . The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined .,Y
7,2307,"Ok . I've got a list of place that fit your requirements . Let's just go through them . The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university .",N
8,2307,How far away is it from the campus ?,N
9,2307,"It's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a main street .",Y
10,2307,That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision .,Y
11,2307,Of course . I'm not very busy at the moment . If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . I can take you there .,Y
12,2307,Thank you . That would be great . __eou__,N
0,2308,Can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ?,N
1,2308,"Yes , ma'ma . There'll be no problem with the quality .",N
2,2308,What if there's something wrong with it ?,Y
3,2308,You don't have to worry about it . We have a one year warranty .,N
4,2308,Are you sure ?,N
5,2308,Sure . We have a good after-sale service . Your satisfaction is guaranteed . __eou__,N
0,2309,What kind of place shall we rent ?,Y
1,2309,"It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .",Y
2,2309,Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .,Y
3,2309,"Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .",Y
4,2309,"I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .",N
5,2309,"Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .",Y
6,2309,"Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .",Y
7,2309,How much do you think the rent will be ?,N
8,2309,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . __eou__,N
0,2310,I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?,N
1,2310,Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .,N
2,2310,"I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony .",Y
3,2310,The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .,Y
4,2310,"Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks .",Y
5,2310,It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .,Y
6,2310,"Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine .",Y
7,2310,The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too .,N
8,2310,"Yes , everything has been well designed . __eou__",N
0,2311,"So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ?",Y
1,2311,"Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course !",Y
2,2311,"So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ?",N
3,2311,"Yes . One bedroom is for my wife and I . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen .",Y
4,2311,What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook .,Y
5,2311,That ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large .,Y
6,2311,Are the rooms nice and bright ?,N
7,2311,"Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows .",N
8,2311,Do you have a balcony ?,N
9,2311,"No , we don ’ t . We wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .",N
10,2311,"You ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ?",Y
11,2311,"It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ? __eou__",Y
0,2312,I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?,Y
1,2312,"You look a bit pale , don't you ?",N
2,2312,"Yes , I can't sleep well every night .",N
3,2312,You should get plenty of sleep .,N
4,2312,I drink a lot of wine .,N
5,2312,"If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much .",N
6,2312,I often feel so tired .,N
7,2312,You better do some exercise every morning .,N
8,2312,I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .,N
9,2312,"Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . __eou__",Y
0,2313,Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?,Y
1,2313,"Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .",Y
2,2313,I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?,N
3,2313,One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !,Y
4,2313,"When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?",N
5,2313,"You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .",Y
6,2313,What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?,N
7,2313,One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .,Y
8,2313,So I need plenty of space for this exercise .,Y
9,2313,"Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .",N
10,2313,Great . Thanks for you advice ! __eou__,N
0,2314,"Mum , can I finish my homework later ?",N
1,2314,Sorry . You know the rules .,N
2,2314,But I want to watch TV now .,N
3,2314,That ’ s out of the question .,N
4,2314,Please .,N
5,2314,Not a chance .,N
6,2314,Not even for an hour ?,N
7,2314,"Sorry , it ’ s impossible . __eou__",N
0,2315,I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ?,N
1,2315,"No , I haven ’ t .",N
2,2315,I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it .,N
3,2315,Perhaps you left that at school .,Y
4,2315,"No , I had it when I left school this afternoon .",N
5,2315,Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there .,N
6,2315,"Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now .",N
7,2315,But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library .,Y
8,2315,Perhaps I should call her later . __eou__,Y
0,2316,Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is .,Y
1,2316,Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment .,N
2,2316,Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair .,N
3,2316,Does he have a moustache or a beard ?,N
4,2316,"Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard .",N
5,2316,"Sounds like Mike , is it ?",N
6,2316,"Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know .",N
7,2316,"Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are .",Y
8,2316,Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that .,N
9,2316,"Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree .",N
10,2316,"I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information .",N
11,2316,"She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too .",N
12,2316,This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is .,N
13,2316,She ’ s your mother !,N
14,2316,How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ?,N
15,2316,"I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now .",Y
16,2316,I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality .,N
17,2316,"Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me ! __eou__",N
0,2317,Shall we have some soup first ?,N
1,2317,"No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with .",N
2,2317,"Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ?",N
3,2317,"Meat , I think .",N
4,2317,Don't you like fish then ?,N
5,2317,"I do , but I want meat .",N
6,2317,Shall we have some white wine then ?,N
7,2317,"Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat .",N
8,2317,What would you like for dessert ?,N
9,2317,"I just want to have a coffee , I think .",N
10,2317,"Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ?",N
11,2317,"No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . __eou__",N
0,2318,Excuse me .,N
1,2318,"Yes , sir . Can I help you ?",N
2,2318,"Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare .",N
3,2318,"Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order .",N
4,2318,"Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ?",N
5,2318,"If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .",N
6,2318,"Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . __eou__",N
0,2319,You say he was around average hight .,N
1,2319,"Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten .",N
2,2319,Weight ?,N
3,2319,"I'm not sure . Medium , I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side .",N
4,2319,Any marks on his face ?,N
5,2319,"No , I don't think so .",N
6,2319,Glasses ?,N
7,2319,No .,N
8,2319,what about his hair ?,Y
9,2319,Black or dark brown .,N
10,2319,Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ?,Y
11,2319,"Straight , I think , and about average length .",N
12,2319,"Boy , this surely doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing .",Y
13,2319,"Well , he had a jacked or a plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear .",N
14,2319,"Ok , now we are getting some where . Pants ?",N
15,2319,"Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure .",Y
16,2319,What kind of shoes ?,N
17,2319,Boots,N
18,2319,Cow while Boots .,N
19,2319,"No , hiking boots . Brown ones .",N

0,2320,There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .,N
1,2320,Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .,Y
2,2320,I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound .,Y
3,2320,"Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .",N
4,2320,That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .,Y
5,2320,Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . __eou__,Y

5,2321,Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at 9 thirty .,N
6,2321,"I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .",N
7,2321,"No , exactly not .",N
8,2321,How about afternoon ?,Y
9,2321,Sounds not good . I won't take it . __eou__,N
0,2322,Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ?,N
1,2322,"No , I'll have the fish please .",N
2,2322,The chicken is also nice .,N
3,2322,"No , I want the fish .",N
4,2322,Our special tonight is lobster .,N
5,2322,"Thank you , but I prefer the fish .",N
6,2322,Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .,Y

0,2323,"Excuse me , sir ?",N

3,2324,"Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ?",N
4,2324,No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night .,N
5,2324,"Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over .",N

4,2382,"Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank .",Y
5,2382,I found some coins that are not from here .,N
6,2382,"Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London . I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound .",Y

0,2385,"Johnny , I want to thank you .",N
1,2385,"What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ?",N
2,2385,"Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy .",N

1,2386,"No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ?",Y

1,2392,My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ?,N
2,2392,"The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume .",N
3,2392,"No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping .",N
4,2392,That's another one thousand six hundred ?,N
5,2392,"Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . __eou__",Y
0,2393,You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome !,N
1,2393,Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing .,Y

3,2393,Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere !,Y
4,2393,"Come on baby , let's dance !",N
5,2393,Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down ! __eou__,N
0,2394,"Sorry to bother you so early . There's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but I thought I'd ask you first .",N
1,2394,That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it .,N
2,2394,"I thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . So why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details .",Y
3,2394,OK . How does seven o'clock this evening sound ?,N
4,2394,Great . See you then . __eou__,N
0,2395,My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month .,N
1,2395,And this espresso looks like ... oil !,Y
2,2395,"It still tastes fine , though .",N
3,2395,"These days , I can't think of anything but motor oil . Even coffee makes me think of it .",Y
4,2395,Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ” __eou__,Y

6,2396,That about does it . See you in a week . __eou__,N
0,2397,"That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .",N
1,2397,I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .,Y
2,2397,That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .,Y
3,2397,"Sure , for at least three thousand per month .",N
4,2397,That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .,Y
5,2397,"I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . __eou__",N
0,2398,"Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days .",N
1,2398,Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water .,Y
2,2398,Sounds a little weak .,N
3,2398,Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee .,Y
4,2398,"Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head .",N
5,2398,"Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . __eou__",N
0,2399,Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ?,Y
1,2399,Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again .,N
2,2399,"I could use one , too . I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign .",Y

3,2400,"Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini .",Y
4,2400,"I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much .",N
5,2400,And I'll stick with real coffee . __eou__,N
0,2401,This motor oil case is still really slippery .,N
1,2401,"Yeah , time for more coffee !",N
2,2401,"Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too .",Y
3,2401,"By the way , I heard Kitty's just got in a shipment of Jamaican Blue Mountain .",Y
4,2401,So what ?,N
5,2401,It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ? __eou__,N
0,2402,Then I'll have to borrow it .,N
1,2402,Sure you can . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month .,Y
2,2402,Why ? It's in mint condition !,N
3,2402,That's why I can profit from it !,N
4,2402,You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ?,N
5,2402,You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ...,Y
6,2402,I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! __eou__,Y
0,2403,"This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet .",N
1,2403,Wow . It's just the two of us . I don't know if we need that much room .,Y
2,2403,You never know when two might turn into three .,Y
3,2403,I guess you're right . And we'd like to have company anyway .,N
4,2403,"Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms .",N
5,2403,Now that's a plus ! __eou__,Y
0,2404,"Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States .",N
1,2404,So what about the tennis racket ?,N
2,2404,Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out !,Y
3,2404,How much did that end up costing you ?,N
4,2404,Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it !,Y
5,2404,"Hey , two for one . That's a super deal .",Y
6,2404,And here's her signature ! __eou__,N
0,2405,So the apartment comes unfurnished ?,N
1,2405,"This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture .",N
2,2405,We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners .,N
3,2405,This building is only four years old . It was built with central air .,N
4,2405,Just like in the States ! That's perfect !,N
5,2405,And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see . __eou__,N
0,2406,I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !,N
1,2406,"I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .",Y
2,2406,This is too good to be true .,N
3,2406,"And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?",N
4,2406,"Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .",N
5,2406,"It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?",Y
6,2406,We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . __eou__,Y
0,2407,They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other !,N
1,2407,What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open !,Y
2,2407,"Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big .",N
3,2407,"It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ?",N
4,2407,With the shipping included--seventy dollars .,N
5,2407,Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that . __eou__,N
0,2408,But this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment .,Y
1,2408,"Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge .",Y
2,2408,"Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ?",Y
3,2408,This balcony is perfect for barbecuing .,Y
4,2408,And we could get a dog !,Y
5,2408,"I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish .",N
6,2408,"Well , fish it will be then . __eou__",Y
0,2409,"Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ...",N
1,2409,"Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets .",N
2,2409,Blow my nose ?,N
3,2409,"Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster .",Y
4,2409,"No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater !",N
5,2409,"It works better than any medicine , Lily . I'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it ! __eou__",Y
0,2410,See ? That wasn't so bad .,N
1,2410,Easy for you to say . My bottom still stings .,N
2,2410,It might be sore for a while . You'll be OK . Now let's go home and rest .,N
3,2410,Can't we go to McDonald's first ?,N
4,2410,"No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice .",N
5,2410,"No , thanks .",N
6,2410,And vegetables with porridge .,Y
7,2410,Blah ... What's that ?,N
8,2410,This is all your medicine . You need to take it four times a day for three days straight . __eou__,N
0,2411,"Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem .",N
1,2411,Why is that ?,N
2,2411,"Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home .",N
3,2411,And the downstairs neighbors ?,N
4,2411,"Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor .",Y
5,2411,Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then . __eou__,N
0,2412,"Morning , Mom .",N
1,2412,I made a doctor's appointment for you .,N
2,2412,"No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor .",N
3,2412,Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school .,N
4,2412,OK . I'll go see the doctor .,N
5,2412,Bundle up . It's wet and rainy out there . Here's some soup .,Y
6,2412,Chicken soup again ?,N
7,2412,"Soup does the body good , sweetie . It's what you need when you're under the weather . __eou__",Y
0,2413,"Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .",Y
1,2413,But I don't have any reading assignments .,N
2,2413,Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .,Y
3,2413,"Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .",N
4,2413,"You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best . __eou__",N
0,2414,This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean !,N
1,2414,Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup .,N
2,2414,"OK , OK .",N
3,2414,"And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again .",N
4,2414,Maybe I'll run away first .,Y
5,2414,"Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine ! __eou__",Y
0,2415,"Johnny , are you just sitting around again ?",N
1,2415,I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet .,N
2,2415,I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful !,N
3,2415,"I'm doing my best , Grandma ...",N
4,2415,"Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty !",N
5,2415,"Uh-oh , here we go ... __eou__",N
0,2416,"Johnny , I can't believe you would do that .",N
1,2416,"I know , Grandma , I just ...",N
2,2416,"You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here !",N
3,2416,Yes'm .,N
4,2416,You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !,N
5,2416,Yes'm .,N
6,2416,And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !,N
7,2416,Yes'm . __eou__,N
0,2417,"Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny .",N
1,2417,"It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson .",N
2,2417,And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ?,N
3,2417,I helped break ... I mean WASH ... all the dishes !,N
4,2417,"That's great . And the garbage , too ?",N
5,2417,"Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now .",N
6,2417,Thanks for your help ! __eou__,N
0,2418,I think I found my Yankee's mug ...,N
1,2418,"Oh , great . Where was it ?",N
2,2418,It fell out of the garbage bag .,N
3,2418,What was it doing there ?,N
4,2418,It was with all the other dishes from dinner .,N
5,2418,You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ?,N
6,2418,I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . __eou__,N
0,2419,"Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ?",N
1,2419,Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ?,Y
2,2419,No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ...,N
3,2419,"Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ...",N
4,2419,I'll find it ... Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ? __eou__,N
0,2420,Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !,N
1,2420,It's more violent than TV news !,N
2,2420,What time is it anyway ?,N
3,2420,Nine-thirty .,N
4,2420,"Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done !",N
5,2420,No time . That's their headlights in the window !,N
6,2420,"OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ...",N
7,2420,"Little dude , your life is over !",N
8,2420,No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . __eou__,N
0,2421,"Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma .",Y
1,2421,"Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here .",N
2,2421,"She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all .",N
3,2421,I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us .,Y
4,2421,"You know , maybe she's just a neat freak .",Y
5,2421,I think she just likes to make us miserable .,N
6,2421,You could be right . __eou__,Y
0,2422,So can we play PlayStation later ?,N
1,2422,"Sure , if you're done !",N
2,2422,"All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ?",N
3,2422,"Well , listen , Honey , you've been a big help lately ...",N
4,2422,Right on . I'm gonna get a new game !,N
5,2422,"If you take out the garbage and do the dishes , I'll think about it .",N
6,2422,I knew there would be a catch !,N
7,2422,"Nothing in life is free , Son .",N
8,2422,"Except housework , that is . __eou__",N
0,2423,So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ?,N
1,2423,"It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try .",Y
2,2423,That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish .,N
3,2423,"Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten .",Y
4,2423,"I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ?",N
5,2423,"There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it .",Y
6,2423,Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food .,Y
7,2423,"Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice .",Y
8,2423,What about veggies ?,Y
9,2423,"They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal .",N
10,2423,It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait ! __eou__,N
0,2424,"Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty !",N
1,2424,"Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ?",N
2,2424,"I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it !",N
3,2424,"You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ?",N
4,2424,I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here !,N
5,2424,"Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ?",N
6,2424,Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor .,N
7,2424,You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here ! __eou__,N
0,2425,"Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck .",N
1,2425,"You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair .",Y
2,2425,"Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ?",N
3,2425,"OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay .",Y
4,2425,"Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work .",N
5,2425,"All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now .",N
6,2425,"That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take .",N
7,2425,"Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ?",Y
8,2425,That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead .,Y
9,2425,"I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan .",N
10,2425,"No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation .",Y
11,2425,"Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__",N
0,2426,"Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ?",N
1,2426,"Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole .",N
2,2426,"I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos .",Y
3,2426,Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ?,N
4,2426,Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili .,N
5,2426,Sounds good .,N
6,2426,Would you like anything to drink ?,N
7,2426,"Sure , I ' ll have a Corona . __eou__",N
0,2427,"Hi , I would like to return this TV .",N
1,2427,"Sure , do you have the receipt ?",N
2,2427,Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .,N
3,2427,Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?,N
4,2427,The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .,N
5,2427,"I see , and what about the keyboard ?",Y
6,2427,I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .,N
7,2427,"I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .",N
8,2427,Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . __eou__,N
0,2428,"Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ?",N
1,2428,“ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ”,N
2,2428,"Trev , are you OK ?",N
3,2428,Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records !,Y
4,2428,Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing .,N
5,2428,No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei . __eou__,N
0,2429,"Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?",N
1,2429,Sure ! What do you feel like having ?,Y
2,2429,I really feel like having a big juicy steak !,N
3,2429,"Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?",Y
4,2429,I didn't know you were a vegetarian !,N
5,2429,"I'm not , I am a vegan .",N
6,2429,A what ?,N
7,2429,"A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .",Y
8,2429,Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !,N
9,2429,"It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult . __eou__",Y
0,2430,I found it at a garage sale once .,N
1,2430,"What a find ! So , how much does it cost ?",N
2,2430,"Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks .",Y
3,2430,Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks .,N
4,2430,"Sixty bucks ? No-can-do , son . You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five .",N
5,2430,Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ... __eou__,N
0,2431,"Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ?",N
1,2431,"Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ?",N
2,2431,Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ?,N
3,2431,"Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming !",N
4,2431,"Yes , so this place had better be clean . You know Grandma ...",N
5,2431,... I know I'll be killed if I pee on the toilet seat .,N
6,2431,And Steve is going to look after you until we come back . __eou__,N
0,2432,Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old .,N
1,2432,Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro .,Y
2,2432,"Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint .",Y
3,2432,No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places .,N
4,2432,This is one of my favorite items .,N
5,2432,How did you get it ? __eou__,N
0,2433,How much for these autographed Elvis records ?,N
1,2433,Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks .,Y
2,2433,"Uh , I'm not sure . Are these all in good condition ?",N
3,2433,Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks .,Y
4,2433,I don't really need five .,N
5,2433,OK . Five for eighty-five bucks . That's my final offer .,N
6,2433,"Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em . __eou__",Y
0,2434,Hello . Do you like this jewelry ? I made most of these items myself .,N
1,2434,You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ?,Y
2,2434,My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry .,Y
3,2434,"Me , too . But I could never make bracelets like these .",N
4,2434,I've been making these designs for over ten years . You can have a bracelet for ten dollars .,N
5,2434,I'll take one right now for seven dollars .,N
6,2434,It's a deal ! __eou__,N
0,2435,Why didn't you text me last night ?,N
1,2435,What ? I sent you three or four messages !,N
2,2435,I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message .,N
3,2435,Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages .,N
4,2435,"Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month .",N
5,2435,I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ?,N
6,2435,"I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages .",N
7,2435,No wonder you didn't get my texts ! __eou__,N
0,2436,"Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ?",N
1,2436,"Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please .",N
2,2436,"Certainly sir , For which day and time please ?",N
3,2436,Tonight at seven .,N
4,2436,"I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .",N
5,2436,"In that case , eight o'clock is fine .",N
6,2436,"Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?",N
7,2436,Four people .,N
8,2436,"Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?",N
9,2436,Mark . __eou__,N
0,2437,"I'm hungry , let's order up something to eat .",N
1,2437,"Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street .",Y
2,2437,"I was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae .",N
3,2437,You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol .,N
4,2437,Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind .,N
5,2437,"It's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . You could really have some health problems later on .",Y
6,2437,"How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! Better yet , let's order some hot dogs !",Y
7,2437,You are a lost cause . __eou__,N
0,2438,"OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ?",Y
1,2438,"Almost , let me just put my apron on .",N
2,2438,"OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit .",Y
3,2438,Got it .,N
4,2438,No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing .,Y
5,2438,Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ?,N
6,2438,"Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients .",Y
7,2438,"OK , so now we need a baking pan right ?",N
8,2438,"Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes .",Y
9,2438,Done . So how long do we bake it for ?,N
10,2438,We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan .,Y
11,2438,Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! __eou__,N
0,2439,Hey honey ! Where were you ?,N
1,2439,I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air .,N
2,2439,How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ?,N
3,2439,"It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit .",N
4,2439,Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox .,Y
5,2439,"Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted !",N
6,2439,You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! __eou__,N
0,2440,What's for dinner ?,N
1,2440,Leftovers .,N
2,2440,What ? Leftovers of what and from when ?,N
3,2440,"From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches !",Y
4,2440,Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ?,N
5,2440,"Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius .",N
6,2440,"Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning .",N
7,2440,"Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! __eou__",Y
0,2441,"Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night .",N
1,2441,Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve .,Y
2,2441,"Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math .",N
3,2441,"I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom .",Y
4,2441,"Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot .",Y
5,2441,Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?,N
6,2441,"Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue .",N
7,2441,"Oh yes , I ... __eou__",Y
0,2442,Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ?,N
1,2442,"Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .",N
2,2442,Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ?,N
3,2442,"No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?",N
4,2442,We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?,Y
5,2442,Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?,N
6,2442,We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .,Y
7,2442,I'll just take a cheesecake .,N
8,2442,Will that be all ?,N
9,2442,Yes .,N
10,2442,Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents . __eou__,N
0,2443,Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say .,N
1,2443,"Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back .",Y
2,2443,"Ok , so can I say , "" This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number "" .",N
3,2443,"That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly .",Y
4,2443,"Ok , so how about this , "" This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! "" .",Y
5,2443,"A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , "" Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks "" .",Y
6,2443,That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ? __eou__,Y
0,2444,"Look , Jimmy's report came today .",N
1,2444,Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ?,N
2,2444,"He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory .",N
3,2444,What about here in physical education ?,Y
4,2444,He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him .,N
5,2444,So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! __eou__,N
0,2445,What did you cook ?,N
1,2445,"Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes .",Y
2,2445,Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ?,N
3,2445,"Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good !",Y
4,2445,This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !,N
5,2445,Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato .,Y
6,2445,This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday !,N
7,2445,"Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish !",Y
8,2445,"Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !",Y
9,2445,Want some more ?,N
10,2445,I'm stuffed ! __eou__,N
0,2446,What are you doing this weekend ?,N
1,2446,My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me .,N
2,2446,Is it a family thing or just friends ?,N
3,2446,"A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood .",Y
4,2446,Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny .,N
5,2446,Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife .,N
6,2446,You mean your sister ?,N
7,2446,"No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother .",N
8,2446,You lost me .,N
9,2446,"I'll explain later , let's go . __eou__",N
0,2447,"Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ?",N
1,2447,Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .,N
2,2447,"Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .",Y
3,2447,What about Rubella and Mumps ?,Y
4,2447,"Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest .",Y
5,2447,"OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago !",N
6,2447,"We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . __eou__",N
0,2448,Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online .,Y
1,2448,"Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ?",N
2,2448,"Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India .",Y
3,2448,"I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !",Y
4,2448,"Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .",Y
5,2448,"Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !",Y
6,2448,"Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .",Y
7,2448,Good idea ! __eou__,Y
0,2449,I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids .,Y
1,2449,What ? Why ?,N
2,2449,"Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .",Y
3,2449,Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction .,Y
4,2449,"Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses .",Y
5,2449,I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea .,N
6,2449,I will bring it up over Sunday brunch .,Y
7,2449,Good luck with that ! __eou__,N
0,2450,"Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ?",N
1,2450,Here you go .,N
2,2450,"I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .",N
3,2450,Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ?,N
4,2450,"We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight .",N
5,2450,What's my other option ?,Y
6,2450,"Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning .",Y
7,2450,That's fine . I'll do that then .,N
8,2450,Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now . __eou__,N
0,2451,What's wrong ?,N
1,2451,"I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode .",N
2,2451,You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .,Y
3,2451,"The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me .",N
4,2451,"They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" .",Y
5,2451,But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?,N
6,2451,"The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .",Y
7,2451,"Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up .",Y
8,2451,"This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable .",Y
9,2451,"Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .",N
10,2451,"This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .",Y
11,2451,Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . __eou__,N
0,2452,"Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all .",N
1,2452,"Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring .",N
2,2452,"OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ?",N
3,2452,"Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi .",N
4,2452,"Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course .",Y
5,2452,Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ?,Y
6,2452,"No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish .",Y
7,2452,"I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ?",N
8,2452,"Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand .",Y
9,2452,Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ?,N
10,2452,"That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay .",Y
11,2452,"Let's see . The label says it's got "" attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . "" Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now .",N
12,2452,"It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely .",Y
13,2452,All right . What varietal is that ?,N
14,2452,"Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess .",Y
15,2452,And you think this is a good wine ?,N
16,2452,"Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma .",Y
17,2452,Perfect ! I'll take it ! __eou__,N
0,2453,Whoa ! This is a massive flea market !,Y
1,2453,You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here .,N
2,2453,And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff .,Y
3,2453,This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it !,Y
4,2453,"You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan .",N
5,2453,"Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings ! __eou__",N
0,2454,You want to go get a facial with me today ?,N
1,2454,"Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that .",N
2,2454,"Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good .",Y
3,2454,True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ?,N
4,2454,"Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks .",Y
5,2454,"That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day .",N
6,2454,"Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it .",N
7,2454,Uh ... no . __eou__,N
0,2455,Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !,N
1,2455,Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .,N
2,2455,But you could have saved money .,N
3,2455,"From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !",N
4,2455,"F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...",Y
5,2455,Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now ! __eou__,Y
0,2456,Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ?,N
1,2456,"I can't , I have to go to the gym .",N
2,2456,"Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble !",Y
3,2456,"Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy .",Y
4,2456,"That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ?",Y
5,2456,"Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats .",Y
6,2456,Sounds like you are really getting in shape ! __eou__,N
0,2457,Of course ! Of course ! Here you are . Thank you so much .,N
1,2457,Are you looking for anything else ?,N
2,2457,"Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous .",Y
3,2457,That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want .,N
4,2457,"Really ? No , no , I couldn't ! You're too nice !",N
5,2457,And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . Have them .,Y
6,2457,Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much . __eou__,N
0,2458,"Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?",N
1,2458,Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .,N
2,2458,That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .,N
3,2458,It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?,Y
4,2458,"Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .",Y
5,2458,"Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?",N
6,2458,Is fifteen dollars OK ? __eou__,N
0,2459,"OK . Do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ?",Y
1,2459,"Can I get my hair done like his ? His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white .",Y
2,2459,Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long .,N
3,2459,What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ?,Y
4,2459,"I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle .",Y
5,2459,"Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ? __eou__",N
0,2460,Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here .,N
1,2460,"Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA .",N
2,2460,Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ?,N
3,2460,OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food .,Y
4,2460,"You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes .",Y
5,2460,"Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good ! __eou__",N
0,2461,How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun !,Y
1,2461,"They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem .",N
2,2461,An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia .,Y
3,2461,It's very “ in ” these days . Some of the places are really expensive .,Y
4,2461,"That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ?",Y
5,2461,"No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too . __eou__",N
0,2462,"Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ?",N

3,2462,"Nice to meet you . I'm Wen , and this is Nikki .",N
4,2462,"How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ?",N
5,2462,She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on .,N
6,2462,Right . Cool ! Let's go ! __eou__,Y
0,2463,"Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore .",N
1,2463,"Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas .",Y
2,2463,"Show me some classic high heels , please .",N
3,2463,"Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ?",Y
4,2463,Black . Classic .,N
5,2463,"Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone .",Y
6,2463,Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe .,Y
7,2463,"OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable .",N
8,2463,"I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for .",Y
9,2463,What size ?,N
10,2463,Seven-and-a-half .,N
11,2463,Here we are . How does it fit ?,N
12,2463,"Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time .",N
13,2463,"Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . __eou__",N
0,2464,I am really interested in buying this television .,N

3,2464,This t . v is only $ 2500 .,N
4,2464,You can't be serious .,N
5,2464,That's how much this t . v costs .,N
6,2464,That's too expensive for me .,N
7,2464,This television is of very high quality .,N
8,2464,You can't go down on the price .,N
9,2464,By how much ?,N
10,2464,I'll buy it for $ 2000 .,N

3,2465,"Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?",Y
4,2465,"Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools .",N

9,2465,"Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! __eou__",N
0,2466,I'm planning on going to the market soon .,N
1,2466,What are you buying ?,N
2,2466,I don't know what we need .,N
3,2466,"I can check for you , if you'd like .",N
4,2466,I'll make a list .,Y
5,2466,"First , we need eggs , milk , and bread .",N
6,2466,"Okay , do we need any meat ?",N
7,2466,"How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ?",Y
8,2466,What else do we need ?,Y

4,2467,Is there anything else wrong with it ?,N
5,2467,"No , that's it .",N
6,2467,I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like .,N

0,2469,"Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started !",Y
1,2469,"Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color .",Y
2,2469,"Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich .",Y
3,2469,"Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them .

Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing .

4,2513,"I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ?",N
5,2513,"Well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy .",Y
6,2513,"Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ?",N

4,2514,What ’ s the difference ?,N
5,2514,"Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online .",Y

0,2517,"Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?",N
1,2517,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation !,Y
2,2517,That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .,N
3,2517,What does that mean ?,N
4,2517,"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer .",Y
5,2517,Me ! Me !,N
6,2517,"Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .",N
7,2517,"Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !",N
8,2517,Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .,Y
9,2517,"Well , OK . But no French kissing !",N
10,2517,"As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .",Y
11,2517,"Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! __eou__",N
0,2518,"Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing !",N

2,2518,"Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ...",N
3,2518,What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! __eou__,Y

1,2661,Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .,N
2,2661,It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .,N
3,2661,You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .,N
4,2661,"Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !",N
5,2661,It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .,N
6,2661,What for ? __eou__,N
0,2662,That way they look longer .,Y
1,2662,Now what are you doing ?,N
2,2662,Putting on mascara .,N

5,2664,They look fake .,N
6,2664,Thanks ! __eou__,N
0,2665,There's so much to do and so little time .,N
1,2665,I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ?,N
2,2665,"Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium !",Y
3,2665,OK ... and what about the buffet and the cake ? Did your mom call the caterer ?,Y
4,2665,"All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted .",N
5,2665,Great . She'll be so happy . __eou__,N
0,2666,"Hey ! Ask your mom for more old pictures , OK ?",Y
1,2666,Can't it wait ? She's still angry that we sent e-mail wedding invitations .,N
2,2666,But we saved your parents so much money ...,N
3,2666,I know . And they're spending enough on the plane tickets to Texas !,Y

4,2667,How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !,Y
5,2667,And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card .,N
6,2667,Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone ! __eou__,Y
0,2668,Who wants to go first ? Allen ?,N
1,2668,Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ?,N
2,2668,OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys !,N
3,2668,"How about "" As long as You Love Me "" ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke !",Y
4,2668,I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! __eou__,N
0,2669,Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ?,Y
1,2669,Are you sure ? How do you know ?,N
2,2669,"Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better !",Y
3,2669,"Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ...",N

2,2670,"You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody !",Y
3,2670,"Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ?",N
4,2670,"If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing .",Y
5,2670,Then I bet he's really good !,Y
6,2670,"Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! __eou__",N
0,2671,So your mom can stop nagging you now .,N
1,2671,Trust me . She'll keep nagging . She thinks something will go wrong .,N
2,2671,Don't tell me she's been listening to the fortune-teller again .,N
3,2671,"You guessed it . She says we have to get married on January 2nd , or we'll have bad luck .",N
4,2671,The day we choose to get married could never be an unlucky day .,Y
5,2671,My mom just wants everything to be perfect for us . __eou__,N
0,2672,"This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable , I think I could fall asleep !",Y
1,2672,Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ?,Y

3,2674,Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us !,Y

1,2675,Squid balls ? How about some more fruit !,Y
2,2675,"Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates !",N
3,2675,"Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ...",N
4,2675,"Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . __eou__",Y
0,2676,Hello again ! Here's another fruit tray for you .,N
1,2676,"Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time .",Y
2,2676,I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity !,Y
3,2676,It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ?,Y
4,2676,"Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off .",N
5,2676,"You know , art is something I've always been interested in ...",Y
6,2676,Enjoy your food ! Bye ! __eou__,N
0,2677,"Taylor , you're looking a little pale . Are you sure you want to hand out nametags ?",N
1,2677,Do I have a choice ? You said the guy who was supposed to do it didn't show .,N
2,2677,"True . Keep up the good work . Hello , welcome to the reunion of the Class of ' 93 .",N
3,2677,"Just come over here , sir . First you need to sign in and get your photo nametag .",N
4,2677,And don't forget to put in an order for your reunion memory book .,N
5,2677,Would you like to donate to our alumni fund ? __eou__,N
0,2678,Did you like the Chanel bag that I got ?,N
1,2678,You must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive !,N
2,2678,I bought it on eBay . It was only one-tenth of the original price . And the purchase was so easy .,N
3,2678,No kidding ! Then how do you know the bag's real ?,N
4,2678,"Well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . But auctioning on eBay is risky .",N
5,2678,A risk I would never take ...,N
6,2678,Then you haven't browsed eBay before ... get online . Don't hang up ! __eou__,N
0,2679,"Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 — let's go !",Y
1,2679,"Hi there , everyone . We hope you're having a good night !",Y
2,2679,Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win !,N
3,2679,"The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .",Y
4,2679,Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be .,N
5,2679,"But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor ! __eou__",Y
0,2680,"Holly ? Holly Madison , is that you ? You look great ! You haven't changed a bit .",N
1,2680,Uh ... Andrew . Hello . I can't quite remember you .,N
2,2680,It's me . The D-man ! I sat behind you in English . Are you and Taylor still dating ?,N
3,2680,Um ... we never were . We're just friends .,N
4,2680,"Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ...",Y
5,2680,"... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ... __eou__",N
0,2681,Ten dollars ? Maybe there are a lot of them ...,Y
1,2681,Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating .,N
2,2681,Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ?,N
3,2681,I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad .,N
4,2681,Some people get nasty on those comments . Maybe you should write him and ask nicely .,Y
5,2681,OK . Wish me luck ! __eou__,N
0,2682,Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it .,N
1,2682,"Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low .",N
2,2682,But there are only two more days until the bidding closes !,N
3,2682,"I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !",N
4,2682,Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket .,N
5,2682,"Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .",N
6,2682,Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ? __eou__,N
0,2683,"So , got any more ideas for the website ?",Y
1,2683,"Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a "" for guests only "" gift chat room .",Y
2,2683,But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there .,N
3,2683,The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient .,Y
4,2683,You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things .,Y
5,2683,Or discuss what gifts they could buy together .,Y
6,2683,Any other ideas ?,Y
7,2683,We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments .,Y
8,2683,And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ...,Y
9,2683,"Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ?",N
10,2683,No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! __eou__,N
0,2684,I decided to give it a go !,Y
1,2684,Good for you . What items did you bid on ?,N
2,2684,A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets !,Y
3,2684,Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me !,N
4,2684,Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty !,N
5,2684,That's not how this game works .,N
6,2684,"Well , there was a sign that said “ Buy now for seventy . ”",Y
7,2684,How many bids had been placed before you ? __eou__,N
0,2685,But what if I don't win what I bid on ?,Y
1,2685,Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap .,N
2,2685,It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions .,Y
3,2685,Sure . I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag .,Y
4,2685,And people are honest ?,N
5,2685,They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... __eou__,Y
0,2686,I was wondering whether you could ship the tennis racket overseas to Taiwan .,Y
1,2686,I'm sorry we don't ship overseas . It's too much trouble .,N
2,2686,"I understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but I am willing to pay extra for shipping .",Y
3,2686,Maybe we could make an exception for you if you win the bid .,Y
4,2686,"Thanks so much ! By the way , is the racket really Serena Williams ’ ?",N
5,2686,Yes . You'll get a picture of Serena playing with the racket and a document from her . __eou__,Y
0,2687,"Brooke , I have bad news .",N
1,2687,What !,N
2,2687,I called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today .,N
3,2687,Don't you dare tell me that ...,N
4,2687,I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats .,N
5,2687,"Well , they should have called you !",N
6,2687,They said that they did . I've been so busy ...,N
7,2687,And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ?,N
8,2687,I didn't think there would be a problem .,N
9,2687,It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets !,Y
10,2687,I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me .,N
11,2687,Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations !,N
12,2687,Brooke ! __eou__,N
0,2688,OK . I just saw a Versace for thirty dollars . This stuff can't be real !,N
1,2688,Most of it is . You should sign up .,N
2,2688,I'm not sure I'd want to give these people my credit card number .,N
3,2688,Didn't you read about Paypal and Bidpai ? They are very safe .,N
4,2688,"Sure , but it's so complicated . They asked for my credit card authorization number .",N
5,2688,That's the last three or four numbers on the back of your credit card where your signature is .,N
6,2688,I have trouble understanding all these forms ... but I'm sure I'll get it . __eou__,N
0,2689,"Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ?",N
1,2689,Ryan says he wants to stay . I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ...,Y
2,2689,"No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ?",N
3,2689,"Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations .",N
4,2689,You're not coming ?,N
5,2689,Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ?,N
6,2689,I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 .,N
7,2689,Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ?,N
8,2689,We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd .,Y
9,2689,"I'm sorry , Mom .",N
10,2689,"Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas .",N
11,2689,"Merry Christmas , Mom . I love you .",N
12,2689,"I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best .",N
13,2689,I know . Goodnight . __eou__,N
0,2690,How much are you planning to buy ?,N
1,2690,"Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping !",Y
2,2690,Cool ! Can I come ?,N
3,2690,No . The front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ...,N
4,2690,But not enough space for me ?,N
5,2690,Not unless you lose about 100 pounds ...,N
6,2690,Billy ... __eou__,N
0,2691,What in the world is that smell ?,N
1,2691,The aroma of roasting coffee beans .,Y
2,2691,Smells like you're baking something . What are those ?,Y
3,2691,Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them .,Y
4,2691,Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ?,N
5,2691,"This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ...",N
6,2691,The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck ! __eou__,N
0,2692,Cute ... Here . These beans are already ground . Now for step three,N
1,2692,So soon ?,N
2,2692,You have to brew the grinds while they're fresh and drink it immediately for the best flavor .,Y
3,2692,"OK ! Hurry , then ! Here's my cup . I can't wait for step four !",N
4,2692,There is no step four ...,N
5,2692,"Yes , there is , drinking your coffee ! __eou__",Y
0,2693,It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot !,Y
1,2693,Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot .,Y
2,2693,You mean half-and-half ?,Y
3,2693,Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames .,Y
4,2693,Good idea .,Y
5,2693,Let's go ! __eou__,Y
0,2694,This broth is wonderful . What's in it ?,N
1,2694,Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !,Y
2,2694,Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths !,N
3,2694,So ?,N
4,2694,You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !,N
5,2694,You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ... __eou__,N
0,2695,Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ?,N
1,2695,The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?,N
2,2695,"Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?",Y
3,2695,"They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .",N
4,2695,"Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !",Y
5,2695,Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .,Y
6,2695,"Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !",Y
7,2695,"They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?",Y
8,2695,Are they from Taiwan ?,N
9,2695,They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .,N
10,2695,OK . I'll take four kiwis . __eou__,N
0,2696,"OK ... well , then how much is one jin ?",N
1,2696,"Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin .",Y
2,2696,"30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ?",N
3,2696,You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT .,N
4,2696,Whew ! That sounds more like my price range . I'll take two liangs .,N
5,2696,I'll have my brother cut some for you .,N
6,2696,This little red fruit looks good . What's it good for ?,Y
7,2696,"That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon !",N
8,2696,"Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ?",N
9,2696,"Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life !",Y
10,2696,And how about these little brown chips ?,Y

5,2805,How much do are you looking to spend ?,N

9,2805,Anything you need to have in the place ?,N

0,2807,What kind of car is best for me ?,N
1,2807,"For you , I would recommend this one here .",N
2,2807,The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ?,N
3,2807,"This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school .",Y
4,2807,That's true . What kind of safety features are we talking about ?,Y
5,2807,"This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical .",Y
6,2807,You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ?,N
7,2807,"Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy .",Y
8,2807,"With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for .",Y
9,2807,"Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over . __eou__",Y
0,2808,"I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these .",Y
1,2808,"There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve .",Y
2,2808,Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off .,Y
3,2808,"Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . __eou__",Y
0,2809,"Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ?",N
1,2809,"Sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . The Wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . Be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . It should cost you 5 yuan .",N
2,2809,"An after I buy the ticket , where should I go ?",N
3,2809,"You can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at Fuxingmen transfer station . After you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards Fuchengmen .",N
4,2809,"So I transfer from red to blue , then how long do I ride the blue ?",N
5,2809,"You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system .",N
6,2809,It sounds so complicated !,N
7,2809,"No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops . __eou__",N
0,2810,This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate .,Y
1,2810,"Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .",Y
2,2810,So it has attracted more and more customers these days .,N
3,2810,"Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well . __eou__",Y
0,2811,The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !,N
1,2811,Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .,N
2,2811,That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !,Y
3,2811,Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .,Y
4,2811,I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . __eou__,Y
0,2812,Want to send out for some Chinese ?,N
1,2812,Some what ?,N
2,2812,"Some Chinese food . I ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .",Y
3,2812,"No , I ’ d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?",Y
4,2812,"Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like .",Y
5,2812,Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?,N
6,2812,"Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can ’ t finish what I ’ Ve ordered .",N
7,2812,What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .,Y
8,2812,Don ’ t worry . We ’ ll just get a doggie bag . __eou__,Y
0,2813,Excuse me ...,N
1,2813,"Yes , sir . How may I be of service ?",N
2,2813,I would like to return this item ... Are refunds allowed ?,N
3,2813,"Certainly . The customer is always right , we are here to serve you . Is there a reason that you would like to return it ? Did you have problems with our product or services ?",N
4,2813,"No , no ... It was just the wrong size .",N
5,2813,Would you be interested in an exchange as opposed to a refund ? I think I can help you to find the appropriate size .,Y
6,2813,No . I would rather just return it .,N
7,2813,"Sure , no problem . Do you happen to have the receipt ?",N
8,2813,"Yeah , right here .",N
9,2813,"Ok , just a moment , please . Here you are , I need you to sign here , please . And here is your refund . Is there anything else I can help you with ?",N

0,2814,"It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ?",Y

1,2982,I'm going to the Golden hotel .,N
2,2982,"Get in , please .",N
3,2982,Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10,N
4,2982,"Don't worry , you'll be there plenty of time . That is it . 7.15 $ , please .",N
5,2982,"Thank you.here ' s 10 $ , just give me 1 $ back , please . __eou__",N
0,2983,Hello .,N
1,2983,"This is Soft , may I speak to Lamely ?",N
2,2983,This is Lamely .,N
3,2983,"Hello , Lamley.Are you free tomorrow ?",N
4,2983,Yes .,N
5,2983,Would you like to go to an activation with me ?,Y
6,2983,I'd like to.see you tomorrow .,N
7,2983,See you . __eou__,N
0,2984,I'm calling to ask about your apartment you advertised .,N
1,2984,"Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery.And they are all newly renovated .",Y
2,2984,"That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office .",N
3,2984,No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details .,Y
4,2984,"I'm sure they are wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .",Y
5,2984,"Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find a very apartment there .",Y
6,2984,Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed dress ?,N
7,2984,Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you can't find the right place .,N
8,2984,OK . Thank you . __eou__,N
0,2985,A friend told me might find a room here .,N
1,2985,Yes . I'll have a room free next week .,N
2,2985,What do you charge ?,N
3,2985,"12,000 yuan a year , but you can't have visitors live in it .",N
4,2985,OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ?,Y
5,2985,Could you come back later ? We're right in the middle of dinner . __eou__,N
0,2986,"Marketing manage office , can I help you ?",N
1,2986,"Mr Green , please .",N
2,2986,"Sorry , he's out .",N
3,2986,What time you suspect back them ?,N
4,2986,"Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?",N
5,2986,"No , thanks . I'll call back later .",N
6,2986,That's fine.please call again later .,N
7,2986,"Ok , thank you.Goodbye . __eou__",N
0,2987,This is the house I want to rent .,N
1,2987,Could you tell me the advantages of it ?,Y
2,2987,"No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .",Y
3,2987,"There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?",N
4,2987,200 dollars per week .,N
5,2987,"In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .",Y
6,2987,"It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .",Y
7,2987,"Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .",Y
8,2987,Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ?,Y
9,2987,I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?,N
10,2987,Twice a week for work and once for shopping .,Y
11,2987,"In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .",Y
12,2987,"That's true . Ok , I will think about it . __eou__",N
0,2988,Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning .,N
1,2988,Where did he go ?,N
2,2988,"I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .",N
3,2988,"Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .",Y
4,2988,"Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .",Y
5,2988,"Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .",Y
6,2988,"In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ?",Y
7,2988,That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?,Y
8,2988,That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . __eou__,N
0,2989,"Hello , Anna speaking !",N
1,2989,"Hey , Anna , this is Jason .",N
2,2989,"Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?",N
3,2989,"Yes . How are you , Anna ?",N
4,2989,I am fine . What have you been doing ?,N
5,2989,Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion .,N
6,2989,"That's great , congratulations !",N
7,2989,"Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .",Y
8,2989,That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .,N
9,2989,You are kidding .,N
10,2989,How long have you been working there ?,N
11,2989,"A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions .",Y
12,2989,How do you like your new boss ?,N
13,2989,She is very nice and open-minded .,N
14,2989,"Much better than the last one , huh ?",N
15,2989,Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots .,Y
16,2989,Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk .,N
17,2989,Good . Tonight 8 o'clock .,N
18,2989,8 it is . See you then .,N
19,2989,Bye . __eou__,N
0,2990,"Excuse me , could you help me ?",N
1,2990,"Yes , what seems to be the problem ?",N
2,2990,Well . I was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ?,N
3,2990,I am afraid not . Have you lost your passport ?,N
4,2990,I think so . I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store .,N
5,2990,Where exactly did you use your passport in the store ?,N
6,2990,In the shoe department . I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques .,N
7,2990,"Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either .",N
8,2990,Then what shall I do ?,N
9,2990,"You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it . These kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up .",Y
10,2990,You are right . Do you have a pen ?,N
11,2990,Here you are .,N
12,2990,"Oh , I seem to lose something every time I travel . __eou__",Y
0,2991,"Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .",N
1,2991,"Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?",N
2,2991,My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .,N
3,2991,"Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes . __eou__",N
0,2992,Can I see the doctor ?,N
1,2992,"Yes , do you have an appointment ?",N
2,2992,"No , I don't .",N
3,2992,Well . The doctor doesn't see nobody without an appointment .,N
4,2992,"Well , I am spending my vacation here and I have a stomachache and ...",N
5,2992,"Oh , I see . Maybe we can fit you in at 3 .",N
6,2992,"I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ...",N
7,2992,"Oh , why didn't you say it's an emergency ? Here , fill out this form and take a seat . I'll send you in next.You don't have insurance ?",N
8,2992,"No , not for this country .",N
9,2992,How about traveler's insurance ?,Y
10,2992,"No , I didn't think I ’ d need it .",N
11,2992,"Can you pay cash , then ?",N
12,2992,"Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain .",N
13,2992,"All right , all right , relax . I am only trying to do my job .",N
14,2992,I know . I am sorry that I yelled at you . __eou__,N
0,2993,How do I set up an E-mail account ?,N
1,2993,"Oh , that's easy . Go to www.onxiu.cn . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope .",N
2,2993,Which link ?,N
3,2993,"That one , the one that says Mail .",N
4,2993,"Oh , no . What did I do ? It's asking me for a password .",N
5,2993,"Don't worry . See where it says , New User ?",N

0,2994,"Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ?",N
1,2994,"Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ?",Y
2,2994,"Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now .",Y
3,2994,"Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ?",N
4,2994,I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ?,N
5,2994,"Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side .",N
6,2994,Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ?,N
7,2994,"Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it .",N
8,2994,"Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ?",N
9,2994,"Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it .",Y
10,2994,"Oh , that will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry . Can I take a bus there ?",N
11,2994,"Well , you could take a bus there , but you would have to transfer buses twice . A taxi would probably be a lot quicker .",Y
12,2994,All right . I guess I'll take a taxi then . How long will it take by taxi ?,N
13,2994,Not too long . It should take about ten mins by taxi .,N
14,2994,"Cool , thanks .",N

2,2995,"Sir , sir , are you all right , sir ?",N
3,2995,He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing .,N
4,2995,"Oh , no . He is not breathing and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 .",N
5,2995,"Hello ? Yes , someone has passed out at Dongle Ave . and 2nd street . He isn't breathing and doesn't have a pulse . Yes , my friend is performing CPR . Ok , thank you . They are sending an ambulance . Here , let me help . __eou__",N

4,2996,"There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it .",N
5,2996,I didn't see it .,N
6,2996,"I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault . __eou__",N
0,2997,My watch always gains ten minutes a day .,N
1,2997,That's funny . My watch always loses ten minutes a day .,N
2,2997,No kidding .,N
3,2997,"I am serious . Every morning I set my watch by the radio , but it still loses ten minutes .",N
4,2997,You know what you can do ?,N
5,2997,Throw it away and buy a new one .,N
6,2997,"No , you don't have to . You only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day .",N
7,2997,So you put your watch back ten minutes every day ?,N
8,2997,"Yes , that's what I am doing .",N
9,2997,"Why bother ? Just buy a new watch . It doesn't cost much . Besides , I just can ’ t put up with this thing any more . __eou__",Y

2,3001,Let me take a look . You know why ? It's clogged with hair . No wonder water won't go down .,N
3,3001,"Well , I guess people who lived here before didn't clean the bathtub .",N
4,3001,You ’ re darn right !,N
5,3001,What should I do now ?,N
6,3001,Don't worry . I ’ Ve got some acid here . It will help dissolve the hair down there .,N

0,3002,Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here !,N
1,3002,"Well , there is air-conditioning . Did you see that window air conditioner there ? The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough .",Y

0,3010,"Ok , so where do you think we can save more money ?",N
1,3010,"Well , we could eat in more . That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants .",Y
2,3010,Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ?,Y
3,3010,"No , I need my books .",N
4,3010,"Come on . If we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy .",Y
5,3010,"Well , what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could have gotten something for less .",N
6,3010,"Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt .",Y
7,3010,All right . That sounds fair . __eou__,N
0,3011,We need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ?,Y
1,3011,Why ?,N
2,3011,"Well , I think we could be saving more .",Y
3,3011,Really ? Well . Ok . Get the receipts out .,N
4,3011,"Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month .",N
5,3011,"That's 1,825 dollars .",N
6,3011,We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account .,N
7,3011,"3,075 . Our paychecks are 3300 combined . That means we don't have any receipts for 225 .",N
8,3011,Right . __eou__,N
0,3012,Where is my back pack ?,N
1,3012,I don't know . Where did you leave it ?,N
2,3012,"I just put it on the chair a while ago , but now it's gone .",N
3,3012,Are you sure ?,N
4,3012,"Of course , I am sure . I bet someone stole it .",N
5,3012,"Well , you should have kept an eye on it . __eou__",N

15,3019,"Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .",N

8,3023,I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference .,N
9,3023,I thought Henry usually did the conferences .,N
10,3023,"Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ?",N
11,3023,I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late .,N

3,3026,I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?,N
4,3026,"Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .",Y
5,3026,You need a babysitter .,N
6,3026,"Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .",Y
7,3026,I could have Suzy stay at my place .,Y
8,3026,"I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",N
9,3026,Why not ?,Y
10,3026,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .,Y
11,3026,"I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",Y

13,3026,I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .,N
14,3026,I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .,Y

Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it .",Y
4,3027,Sure that ’ s fine.This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ?,N
5,3027,"Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ?",Y

2,3028,Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ?,N
3,3028,"Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago .",N
4,3028,We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .,N
5,3028,"Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?",Y
6,3028,"First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .",Y
7,3028,I see . What else ?,Y
8,3028,"We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .",Y
9,3028,"Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money .",Y
10,3028,"Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . __eou__",N

3,3029,just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil .,N
4,3029,we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .,Y
5,3029,I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?,N
6,3029,I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .,N
7,3029,"ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .",Y
8,3029,we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .,Y

5,3031,What ’ s the difference ?,N
6,3031,"Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online .",Y

0,3034,"in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people .",Y
1,3034,"maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they",Y
2,3034,"yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish",Y
3,3034,"then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people .",Y
4,3034,"well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit tea",Y

4,3036,"well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .",Y

1,3065,I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes .,Y
2,3065,Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first .,Y
3,3065,"If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave .",Y
4,3065,They could go out and play with their friends .,Y
5,3065,Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time .,Y
6,3065,Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too .,Y
7,3065,"That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit . __eou__",Y
0,3066,Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?,N
1,3066,"Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very c",N
2,3066,How often do you run your anti-virus program ?,N
3,3066,I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .,N
4,3066,Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?,N
5,3066,Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .,Y
6,3066,That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?,N
7,3066,Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .,N
8,3066,What do you use your computer for ?,N
9,3066,"I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you",Y
10,3066,"Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them . __eou__",Y

1,3067,"Well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , DVDs , and a lot of nice clothing , too .",Y
2,3067,How about we go to the yard sale first and then to the university flea market ?,Y
3,3067,"Good idea , let's shop to we drop ! __eou__",Y
0,3068,"Hello , sir , what can I do for you today ?",N
1,3068,"Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp .",N
2,3068,"No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .",N
3,3068,"Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool .",Y
4,3068,Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?,Y
5,3068,Sure . I ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .,N
6,3068,"Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts . __eou__",Y
0,3069,Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .,N

2,3069,I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .,Y
3,3069,Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net .,N
4,3069,"When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?",N
5,3069,"Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone .",N
6,3069,"When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .",N
7,3069,"That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .",Y
8,3069,That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time,Y
9,3069,How do I do that ?,N
10,3069,"Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will",N
11,3069,That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . __eou__,N
0,3070,How often do you use the internet ?,N
1,3070,"I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ?",Y
2,3070,Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor .,N
3,3070,"So , you ’ re online eight hours a day .",N
4,3070,"Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online .",Y
5,3070,How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?,N
6,3070,"I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .",Y
7,3070,How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ?,Y
8,3070,What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . __eou__,Y
0,3071,Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .,N
1,3071,"Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .",N
2,3071,Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?,N
3,3071,"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !",Y
4,3071,That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?,N
5,3071,No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .,N
6,3071,"So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?",N
7,3071,I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .,Y
8,3071,"I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a",Y

0,3072,You're finally here ! What took so long ?,N
1,3072,I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .,N
2,3072,It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .,Y
3,3072,"I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .",N
4,3072,perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .,Y
5,3072,I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .,N
6,3072,"It would be better for the environment , too .",Y
7,3072,I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .,Y
8,3072,Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .,Y
9,3072,The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .,N
10,3072,"Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .",Y
11,3072,That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !,Y
12,3072,"So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?",N
13,3072,"Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . __eou__",N
0,3073,"I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat .",N
1,3073,Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .,Y
2,3073,Will you take long ?,N
3,3073,No ! Five minutes I promise !,N
4,3073,Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !,N
5,3073,"Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq",Y
6,3073,Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !,N
7,3073,"What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...",Y
8,3073,Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! __eou__,N

4,3075,Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?,N
5,3075,It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .,N
6,3075,That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?,Y
7,3075,"A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !",Y

1,3077,Are you trying to lose weight ?,N
2,3077,"Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles .",N
3,3077,You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong .,Y
4,3077,"Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?",Y
5,3077,"Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors .",N
6,3077,"So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ?",Y
7,3077,Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish .,Y
8,3077,If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ?,Y

0,3081,Ok ! I ’ m ready for my driving lesson ! Should I start the car ?,N

2,3085,What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !,N
3,3085,"Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !",Y

6,3085,I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !,N
7,3085,"This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! __eou__",Y
0,3086,"Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !",N
1,3086,"I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .",N
2,3086,"Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .",N
3,3086,"So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?",N
4,3086,"Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .",Y
5,3086,Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?,N
6,3086,"No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .",N
7,3086,You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . __eou__,Y
0,3087,Ah ! No ! Damn it !,N
1,3087,It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .,N

4,3087,"No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .",N
5,3087,"I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .",Y
6,3087,I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .,N
7,3087,What are we going to do now ?,N
8,3087,I don't know . I feel like going out .,N
9,3087,I wonder how much of the city is down .,Y
10,3087,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .,N
11,3087,"Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .",Y
12,3087,"Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen .",N

15,3087,I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .,N
16,3087,"Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ?",Y
17,3087,"No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .",N
18,3087,So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?,N
19,3087,How many students are in the class ?,N

0,3088,Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ?,N
1,3088,Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house .,N
2,3088,Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .,Y
3,3088,"I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well .",N
4,3088,"Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !",Y
5,3088,Do I have to pay an installation fee ?,N
6,3088,"Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive !",Y
7,3088,Awesome ! __eou__,N
0,3089,Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ?,N
1,3089,"Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !",N
2,3089,"I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .",N
3,3089,"Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .",N
4,3089,"Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .",Y
5,3089,That would be great ! Is it expensive ?,N
6,3089,Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . __eou__,N
0,3090,"Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan .",Y
1,3090,"I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US . it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network .",N
2,3090,What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone .,N
3,3090,"Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free .",Y
4,3090,Really ? What ’ s the catch ?,N
5,3090,"There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ regiving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan .",Y
6,3090,So what does this plan include ?,N
7,3090,"Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option .",Y
8,3090,"Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ?",N
9,3090,"That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... __eou__",N

2,3091,"Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew .",N
3,3091,"I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party !",N
4,3091,"I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister !",N
5,3091,Mom ! That is so unfair !,N
6,3091,You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down !,N
7,3091,What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding !,N
8,3091,I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! __eou__,N
0,3092,"Hi , did you call for an exterminator ?",N
1,3092,Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy !,N
2,3092,What sort of pest are we dealing with ?,N
3,3092,"We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard !",N
4,3092,"Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu",Y
5,3092,"No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! __eou__",N
0,3093,"Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ?",N
1,3093,"Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement .",N

3,3093,"No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .",N
4,3093,"Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then .",N
5,3093,"Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .",Y
6,3093,That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?,N
7,3093,"No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .",N
8,3093,Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract . __eou__,Y
0,3094,"Hi , excuse me sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore .",N
1,3094,"Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas .",Y
2,3094,"Show me some classic high heels , please .",N
3,3094,"Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ?",Y
4,3094,Black . Classic .,N
5,3094,"Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone .",Y
6,3094,Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe .,Y
7,3094,"OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable .",N
8,3094,I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly .,Y
9,3094,What size ?,N
10,3094,Seven-and-a-half .,N
11,3094,Here we are . How does it fit ?,N
12,3094,"Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo",Y

3,3095,"I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !",Y
4,3095,"What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .",Y
5,3095,Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?,Y
6,3095,"We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .",N
7,3095,Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !,Y

3,3097,"Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?",Y
4,3097,"Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools .",N
5,3097,What type of tools ?,N
6,3097,"You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe .",Y
7,3097,Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ?,N
8,3097,I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done !,Y
9,3097,"Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! __eou__",N
0,3098,"Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals .",N

3,3098,"I wish I could , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .",N

5,3098,"Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ?",Y

10,3098,"Well , I also have ... __eou__",Y
0,3099,Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ?,N
1,3099,"Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .",N
2,3099,"You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so",Y
3,3099,"Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have",Y
4,3099,"I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great",Y

2,3100,"But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus .",N
3,3100,"Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems .",N
4,3100,Ok . Anything else ?,N
5,3100,"Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !",N
6,3100,Um yeah.Sorry about that . __eou__,N
0,3101,I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !,N
1,3101,I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .,N
2,3101,"Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it .",Y
3,3101,"I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .",Y
4,3101,"How do you mean "" suffer "" ?",N
5,3101,"I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .",Y
6,3101,Even in the winter ?,Y
7,3101,"Yes , even in the winter .",Y
8,3101,"And even if it takes two hours , huh ?",Y
9,3101,Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !,Y
10,3101,"Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .",N
11,3101,Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !,Y
12,3101,"I know . I can see that . This is what is called "" dim sum , "" right ?",N
13,3101,"Yes , all these dishes are different "" dim sum "" dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .",Y
14,3101,"So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ?",N
15,3101,Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .,Y
16,3101,"And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .",Y
17,3101,No way !,N
18,3101,What do you mean ?,N
19,3101,"We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .",N
20,3101,"Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ?",N
21,3101,"No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the "" new "" Chinatown .",Y
22,3101,Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?,Y
23,3101,"No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .",N
24,3101,I wonder if you can cook things this good .,Y
25,3101,I'm a great cook actually . You will see . __eou__,Y
0,3102,Why don't you watch where you're going ?,N
1,3102,Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !,N
2,3102,There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .,N
3,3102,"Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .",N
4,3102,I think my arm is broken .,N
5,3102,"Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .",N
6,3102,"Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .",N
7,3102,Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .,N
8,3102,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",Y
9,3102,Alright .,N
10,3102,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,N
11,3102,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",N
12,3102,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,Y
13,3102,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",N
14,3102,It really hurts .,N
15,3102,"Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",N
16,3102,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,N
17,3102,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",N
18,3102,To hell with you . __eou__,N
0,3103,Excuse me .,N
1,3103,Yeah ?,N
2,3103,I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ?,Y
3,3103,You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy .,N
4,3103,"Yes , but ... well ...",N
5,3103,What ?,N
6,3103,How do I use the machines ?,N
7,3103,What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers .,N
8,3103,I see . Do the machines have soap in them ?,N
9,3103,"No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ?",N
10,3103,No . I don't have soap .,N
11,3103,"Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there .",N
12,3103,Thanks.Okay . I have my soap .,N
13,3103,My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ?,N
14,3103,I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean .,N
15,3103,But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out .,N
16,3103,Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before .,N
17,3103,What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ?,N
18,3103,Yes .,N
19,3103,In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ?,N
20,3103,No . Never .,N
21,3103,I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ?,N
22,3103,I'm nineteen .,N
23,3103,But how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ?,Y
24,3103,My mother always did it .,N
25,3103,"Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself .",N
26,3103,"I know about this fact.American children are more independent . They do more for themselves.But I am from Taiwan . In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before . You shouldn't laugh at me for it .",N
27,3103,I'm not laughing at you . But let me ask you something ?,N
28,3103,What ?,N
29,3103,"How are you going to survive here ? I mean , if you can't do anything for yourself.If you can't cook , if you can't wash clothes , if you can't clean house.How can you live on your own ?",Y
30,3103,I don't know . It's hard . But I have to learn .,N
31,3103,"Well , I'll help you learn how to use these machines .",N
32,3103,Thanks . My name's Nick .,N
33,3103,I'm Alice . I guess I'll have to be your mother for today .,N

5,3104,"You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .",Y
6,3104,Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?,N
7,3104,"Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good !",N
8,3104,Great ! Can you set the table ?,N

0,3105,"Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .",N
1,3105,"Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?",N
2,3105,"Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .",Y
3,3105,"I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .",N
4,3105,"But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .",Y
5,3105,"Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .",Y
6,3105,"Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . __eou__",N
0,3106,"Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ?",N
1,3106,"Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins .",Y
2,3106,Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ?,N
3,3106,"Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up .",N
4,3106,"Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers .",N
5,3106,"You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !",N
6,3106,"You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ?",Y
7,3106,You ’ re so picky sometimes .,N
8,3106,"Here you go , honey , fried eggs .",N
9,3106,I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . __eou__,N
0,3107,I really appreciate your driving me around .,N
1,3107,"It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place .",Y
2,3107,It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .,N
3,3107,So what do you see in there ?,Y
4,3107,This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .,N
5,3107,Can you afford that much ?,N
6,3107,"No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency .",Y
7,3107,"Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .",Y
8,3107,How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?,Y
9,3107,That means the apartment has furniture in it .,N
10,3107,That's good .,N
11,3107,"Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .",N
12,3107,Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .,N
13,3107,It's still pretty expensive .,N
14,3107,"Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .",Y
15,3107,Alright . What's the phone number ?,N
16,3107,256-7797 .,N
17,3107,Got it . What else do you see ?,Y
18,3107,This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?,N
19,3107,"No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom .",N
20,3107,That sounds alright .,N
21,3107,"Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .",Y
22,3107,"Here's the number , 256-4367 .",N
23,3107,Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .,N
24,3107,Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .,N
25,3107,"Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ? __eou__",N
0,3108,Can I help you ?,N
1,3108,"Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?",N
2,3108,"Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?",Y
3,3108,Mostly cassette tapes .,N
4,3108,Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .,Y
5,3108,Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .,N
6,3108,"It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .",N
7,3108,I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .,N
8,3108,Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?,N
9,3108,"Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .",N
10,3108,"Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ?",Y
11,3108,"Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .",N
12,3108,"Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse .",Y
13,3108,How much is it ?,N
14,3108,This one sells for $ 39.99 .,N
15,3108,Can I test it out ?,Y
16,3108,Of course .,N
17,3108,It sounds great . I'll take it .,N
18,3108,Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment .,N
19,3108,Thanks . __eou__,N
0,3109,Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .,N
1,3109,What part hurts ?,N
2,3109,The shoulder .,N
3,3109,"Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .",N
4,3109,It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .,N
5,3109,C'mon . Just don't move .,N
6,3109,I'm bleeding too much .,N
7,3109,"We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",Y
8,3109,"Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !",Y
9,3109,"There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",Y
10,3109,"Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",Y
11,3109,Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .,N
12,3109,"No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .",N
13,3109,"Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?",N
14,3109,"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !",N
15,3109,We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .,N
16,3109,I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .,N
17,3109,"Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?",N
18,3109,Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .,N
19,3109,"Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .",Y
20,3109,There . Stop ! __eou__,N
0,3110,"Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?",N
1,3110,"Sorry , it ’ s all sold out .",N
2,3110,"Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?",N
3,3110,We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .,N
4,3110,Ok . I ’ ll take it .,N
5,3110,Where would you like to sit ?,N
6,3110,"Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .",N
7,3110,Certainly . __eou__,N
0,3111,"Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I &",N
1,3111,NO !,N
2,3111,I haven't even told you what it is yet !,N
3,3111,"Okay , okay , what do you want ?",N
4,3111,Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to concert tonight .,Y
5,3111,Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother .,N
6,3111,"Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him !",N
7,3111,Who's this Eric guy ?,N
8,3111,"Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please !",N
9,3111,No can do ... sorry .,N
10,3111,Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?,N
11,3111,No way !,N
12,3111,That ’ s so unfair ! __eou__,N
0,3112,"Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ?",N
1,3112,"Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .",N
2,3112,We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?,N
3,3112,"Sure , that sounds good .",N
4,3112,Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?,N
5,3112,"No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .",Y
6,3112,"Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !",Y
7,3112,Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..,N
8,3112,wait ! ! I need your address ! __eou__,N
0,3113,The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !,N
1,3113,Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .,N
2,3113,That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !,Y
3,3113,Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .,Y
4,3113,I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . __eou__,Y
0,3114,Hello . May I help you ?,N
1,3114,"Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ?",N
2,3114,That one is one hundred and fifty dollars .,N
3,3114,One hundred and fifty dollars ? What about this other one over here ?,Y
4,3114,That ’ s one hundred and forty .,N
5,3114,Hmm ... that ’ s a bit out of my price range . Can you give me a better deal ?,N
6,3114,This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price .,N
7,3114,"Well , I don ’ t know . I think I ’ ll shop around .",N
8,3114,"Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ?",N
9,3114,That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ?,Y
10,3114,"Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both .",N
11,3114,I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway .,N
12,3114,my final price ! One hundred dollars for both ! That ’ s two for the price of one . That ’ s my last offer !,Y
13,3114,Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal ! __eou__,N
0,3115,"I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from .",N
1,3115,I would like to rent a car with a good stereo .,N
2,3115,"All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us .",Y
3,3115,Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time .,N
4,3115,"Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot .",Y
5,3115,This is a Porsche !,N
6,3115,"Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ?",N
7,3115,But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive .,N
8,3115,"Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars .",Y
9,3115,But how can you do that ?,N
10,3115,"It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ?",N
11,3115,"Yes , it almost looks new . __eou__",N
0,3116,"I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",Y
1,3116,Alright .,N
2,3116,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,N
3,3116,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",N
4,3116,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,Y
5,3116,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",N
6,3116,It really hurts .,N
7,3116,"Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",N
8,3116,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,N
9,3116,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",N
10,3116,To hell with you . __eou__,N
0,3117,"Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?",N
1,3117,"Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .",Y
2,3117,"You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .",N
3,3117,Can I return the car in San Francisco ?,N
4,3117,"San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .",N
5,3117,Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .,Y
6,3117,"No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .",N
7,3117,"Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .",N
8,3117,"Do you still want the car , sir ?",N
9,3117,Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .,Y
10,3117,It's a beautiful drive .,N
11,3117,Where are the keys ?,N
12,3117,"Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . __eou__",N
0,3118,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !,N
1,3118,"I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .",N
2,3118,I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !,Y
3,3118,I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?,N
4,3118,I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .,N
5,3118,"Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?",Y
6,3118,I don't know .,N
7,3118,"I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .",Y
8,3118,What do you mean ?,N
9,3118,"We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .",Y
10,3118,I have plenty of gas .,N
11,3118,"Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .",N
12,3118,So what can we do ?,Y
13,3118,"Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .",Y
14,3118,Alright . That's a good idea .,Y
15,3118,I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .,N
16,3118,Days ?,N
17,3118,"Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .",Y
18,3118,"Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .",N
19,3118,Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .,Y
20,3118,"Okay , I'll follow your advice . __eou__",N
0,3119,"Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ?",N
1,3119,umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday .,Y
2,3119,"Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ?",Y
3,3119,"No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss .",N
4,3119,"Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ?",Y
5,3119,That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous .,N
6,3119,"Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece .",Y
7,3119,"Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ?",Y
8,3119,"We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her .",Y
9,3119,"Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ...",Y
10,3119,Perhaps you could give her a ring ?,Y
11,3119,Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous .,Y
12,3119,"Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !",Y
13,3119,"Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question !",Y
14,3119,Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . __eou__,Y
0,3120,Ah ! No ! Damn it !,N
1,3120,It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .,N
2,3120,So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .,N
3,3120,Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?,N
4,3120,"No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .",N
5,3120,"I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .",Y
6,3120,I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .,N
7,3120,What are we going to do now ?,N
8,3120,I don't know . I feel like going out .,N
9,3120,I wonder how much of the city is down .,Y
10,3120,It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .,N
11,3120,"Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .",Y
12,3120,"Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen .",N
13,3120,"I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .",Y
14,3120,Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?,N
15,3120,I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .,N
16,3120,"Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ?",Y
17,3120,"No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .",N
18,3120,So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?,N
19,3120,How many students are in the class ?,N
20,3120,About fourteen .,N
21,3120,"So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .",N
22,3120,Damn ! __eou__,N
0,3121,Can you finish your homework in ten minutes ?,N
1,3121,It will be a piece of cake . __eou__,N
0,3122,I'm sorry I scratched your car .,N
1,3122,Don't worry about it . It's just a drop in the bucket . That car has more scratches on it than I can count . __eou__,N
0,3123,"Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed !",N
1,3123,"Son , you just go back to bed , and stop crying wolf . __eou__",N
0,3124,"Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?",N
1,3124,"Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation . __eou__",N
0,3125,"May I have a look at that vase , please ?",N
1,3125,Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .,Y
2,3125,"Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .",N
3,3125,Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? __eou__,N
0,3126,Can you give me a hand with the dishes ?,N
1,3126,Sure . Should I wash or dry ?,N
2,3126,I wash and you'll dry .,N
3,3126,OK . Let's do it . __eou__,Y

2,3128,By air or by sea ?,N
3,3128,By air . So my gift should be quite light . What can you suggest ?,Y
4,3128,How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather .,Y
5,3128,My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual .,Y
6,3128,This gift is the best for a man who has everything .,N
7,3128,"Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it . __eou__",N
0,3129,I'm concerned about your car .,N

3,3130,Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's . __eou__,N
0,3131,"Sir , would you like some dessert now ?",N
1,3131,Please show me the menu again .,N
2,3131,"Here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious .",N
3,3131,"No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie .",N
4,3131,I am afraid there is none .,N
5,3131,Then I'll have vanilla ice cream .,N
6,3131,Fine . I will bring it right away . __eou__,N
0,3132,"I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can ’ t find a cheap plane ticket .",N

1,3133,"Well , I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - - here , in the pool .",Y
2,3133,Why ?,N
3,3133,"Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here .",Y
4,3133,Have you thought about graduate school ?,Y
5,3133,No .,N
6,3133,Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ?,N
7,3133,You got me .,N
8,3133,"Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . __eou__",Y
0,3134,"Oh , no . We ’ re going to be late for the meeting .",N
1,3134,No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway .,N
2,3134,"Oh , good .",N
3,3134,How much will it cost ?,N
4,3134,"Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars .",N

10,3180,Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time . __eou__,N
0,3181,What do you think this flat ?,N
1,3181,It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us .,N
2,3181,"Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think .",Y
3,3181,"But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good .",Y

7,3182,I can ’ t take that .,N
8,3182,I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 .,N
9,3182,I honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you .,N
10,3182,You can ’ t go any lower than that ?,N

5,3183,"Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice .",Y
6,3183,Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?,N
7,3183,"Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .",Y
8,3183,How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?,N

5,3186,Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?,Y
6,3186,It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters .,N
7,3186,I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better .,Y
8,3186,OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . __eou__,N
0,3187,This house is not looking all that great from here,N
1,3187,You can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ’ s go inside .,Y
2,3187,I don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here .,N
3,3187,I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .,Y
4,3187,It is just too dark in here with so few windows .,Y
5,3187,I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ’ s go check it out .,Y
6,3187,"The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space .",Y
7,3187,The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better .,Y
8,3187,How many dogs live in this house ?,N
9,3187,I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let ’ s go look at another house . __eou__,Y
0,3188,"Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house !",N
1,3188,It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside .,Y
2,3188,It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place .,Y
3,3188,"You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit .",Y
4,3188,"There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy .",Y
5,3188,Let ’ s go check out the kitchen . The printout says that it is quite large .,Y
6,3188,Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper .,Y
7,3188,"Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . Follow me , please .",Y
8,3188,What ’ s that smell ?,N
9,3188,Perhaps we should move on to the next listing . __eou__,Y
0,3189,"Hi , can I speak with the apartment manager , please ?",N

7,3193,You will ?,N
8,3193,"Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?",N
9,3193,That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .,N

0,3194,What do you think about the apartment so far ?,N

2,3194,You don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ?,N
3,3194,"Actually , there is a problem .",N
4,3194,Like what ?,N
5,3194,There are some stains that were left in the carpet .,N
6,3194,Those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in .,N
7,3194,"Oh , is that right ?",N
8,3194,Yes . Now what other problems do you have ?,N

3,3196,I do have one problem with the apartment .,N
4,3196,What ’ s the problem ?,N
5,3196,I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .,N
6,3196,We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .,N
7,3196,I did not know that .,N
8,3196,"I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .",N
9,3196,That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .,N
10,3196,I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .,N
11,3196,It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it . __eou__,N
0,3197,I would love to rent out your apartment .,N
1,3197,That ’ s great .,N
2,3197,How much is the rent ?,N
3,3197,The rent each month is $ 1050 .,N
4,3197,That ’ s a lot of money .,N
5,3197,Did you have a better price in mind ?,N
6,3197,What about $ 800 ?,N
7,3197,That ’ s way too low .,N
8,3197,I can ’ t pay much more than that .,N

0,3198,"I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .",N
1,3198,"First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?",Y
2,3198,I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .,N
3,3198,"I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in .",N
4,3198,Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?,N
5,3198,"Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of .",Y
6,3198,Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?,N
7,3198,You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .,Y
8,3198,What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?,N
9,3198,There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found . __eou__,N
0,3199,What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ?,N
1,3199,The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time .,N
2,3199,What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ?,N
3,3199,"You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name .",Y
4,3199,"There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning .",Y
5,3199,Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived .,Y
6,3199,I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in .,N
7,3199,That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away .,N
8,3199,I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ?,Y
9,3199,"I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is ! __eou__",N
0,3200,Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ?,N
1,3200,"Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ?",N
2,3200,I never had a home inspection before .,N
3,3200,I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through .,Y
4,3200,"I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house .",N
5,3200,"The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future .",Y
6,3200,I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes .,N
7,3200,"I inform you of the problems . If there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems .",N
8,3200,What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ?,N
9,3200,"I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist . __eou__",N
0,3201,What would be a good day to finally move into the house ?,N
1,3201,You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night . When you actually move in is up to you .,N
2,3201,"Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ?",N
3,3201,Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in .,N
4,3201,"The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color .",Y
5,3201,An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in .,Y
6,3201,I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house .,N
7,3201,I think that will work out just fine . It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold .,Y
8,3201,Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in ?,Y
9,3201,My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day . __eou__,N
0,3202,"Hello , I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager .",N
1,3202,I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ?,N
2,3202,I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available .,N
3,3202,"Yes , it's still vacant . Are you interested in seeing it ?",N
4,3202,"Yes , I would love to see the apartment .",N
5,3202,I will be at the apartment today at 6,N
6,3202,"Yes , I can be there at 6 .",N
7,3202,Great . I'll see you at 6 . Do you know where it is ?,N
8,3202,"Yes , I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .",N
9,3202,I'll be bringing an application form .,N
10,3202,"OK , should I bring anything with me ?",N
11,3202,"No . I might need to see your ID card , but that's about it . __eou__",N
0,3203,I came in to see how my home inspection went .,N
1,3203,"First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ?",N
2,3203,"I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it .",N
3,3203,I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it .,N
4,3203,"The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month .",N
5,3203,"Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken .",Y
6,3203,Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ?,N
7,3203,"The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced .",Y
8,3203,Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ?,N
9,3203,The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe . __eou__,N
0,3204,When can I move into my new house ?,N
1,3204,"The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday .",Y
2,3204,Will the utilities be turned on ?,N
3,3204,You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name .,N
4,3204,I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .,Y
5,3204,"If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in .",Y
6,3204,I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in .,Y
7,3204,"That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away .",Y
8,3204,Can you help me on my move-in day ?,Y
9,3204,I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is . __eou__,Y
0,3205,"so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?",Y
1,3205,"yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .",Y
2,3205,That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .,N
3,3205,yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .,Y

12,3260,My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too .,Y
13,3260,"Well , do what you like.There are different kinds of New Balance shoes though.You don't have to buy the most expensive .",Y
14,3260,I want the best.My sister said good shoes are very important . For support . They support your feet .,Y
15,3260,"Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ?",N
16,3260,"No , but she exercises more than me .",N
17,3260,I really think you are stubborn about some things.But here . Let's look at the New Balance shoes .,Y
18,3260,Here it is . This is what my sister has .,N
19,3260,"Yes , that's it . That's their top model .",N

22,3260,"Here in America , it's six .",N
23,3260,"Well , here you are . Size six . Woman's . 137 dollars.Wow , what a waste of money !",N

1,3261,I've always got room for something sweet !,Y
2,3261,what are you going to try first ?,N
3,3261,"I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt , so I want to try that first .",Y
4,3261,do they serve the yogurt with anything ?,N
5,3261,I believe they add locally produced honey to it .,N
6,3261,that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu .,Y
7,3261,do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece .,Y
8,3261,ok . Mmm .,N
9,3261,what do you think ? How does it taste ?,N
10,3261,"it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ?",Y
11,3261,sure . I'll just have a bite .,N
12,3261,what do you think ? Does it taste good ?,N
13,3261,it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had !,N
14,3261,I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ?,N
15,3261,ok . I've had one of those before . They're really sweet and crunchy .,N
16,3261,do you know where they are from .,N
17,3261,I believe they are a local delicacy in the South .,Y
18,3261,"do you want me to get you one , too ?",N
19,3261,"yeah , why not ? We've already pigged out as it is !",Y
20,3261,"ok , I'll be back with two fried bananas in a few minutes . Wait for me here ! __eou__",N
0,3262,I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs .,N
1,3262,"Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord .",N
2,3262,What does it come with standard ?,N
3,3262,"On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com",Y
4,3262,Cruise control ? I don't like that .,N
5,3262,"Why not , sir ?",Y
6,3262,I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ?,N
7,3262,"Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident .",Y
8,3262,I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either .,N
9,3262,"You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .",Y
10,3262,I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ?,Y
11,3262,"No , the sunroof is optional , sir .",N
12,3262,I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .,Y
13,3262,"Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August.If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .",Y
14,3262,"That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?",N
15,3262,"We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .",Y
16,3262,My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .,Y
17,3262,"I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?",N
18,3262,"Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?",N
19,3262,"Yes , you can.That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .",N
20,3262,"Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then.It looks like an excellent car .",N
21,3262,"You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .",N
22,3262,"Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else.The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .",N
23,3262,"Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . __eou__",N
0,3263,Why don't we get you some shirts ?,Y
1,3263,I want to leave . We've already been here two hours .,N
2,3263,But we should get you some shirts while we're here . You need summer shirts .,Y
3,3263,I would rather buy them somewhere else .,N
4,3263,Why ? They have everything here .,N
5,3263,I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety .,Y
6,3263,Let's just look and see what they have .,Y
7,3263,Alright .,N
8,3263,What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ?,N
9,3263,The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping .,Y
10,3263,"Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself .",N
11,3263,Sure I would .,N
12,3263,Here . Look at this shirt . Try it on .,N
13,3263,Do they have it in LARGE .,N
14,3263,I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on .,Y
15,3263,Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it .,N
16,3263,The fitting rooms are over there .,N
17,3263,"Okay , I will try it on .",N
18,3263,It looks good on you .,N
19,3263,I look like a nerd .,N
20,3263,"No , it looks great.Why are you always like this when you're shopping ? You know it looks good .",N
21,3263,"Well , I don't think it's the best style for me .",N
22,3263,I think we'll buy this one . And I want you to try on this one too .,Y
23,3263,Alright . Alright .,N
24,3263,"You should be happy I want you to look good.If I let you shop for yourself , you would never buy anything .",N
25,3263,"Yes , maybe . But I like street shopping . There is more variety . I'm sorry . I just don't like malls . __eou__",Y
0,3264,I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it .,N
1,3264,"It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions .",N
2,3264,What instructions ?,N
3,3264,We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table .,N
4,3264,"I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know .",Y
5,3264,Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy !,N
6,3264,Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ?,N
7,3264,"Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper .",Y
8,3264,Do I have to sand every inch of the table ?,N
9,3264,"The better you sand it , the better the finish will be .",Y
10,3264,Alright .,N
11,3264,"Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .",Y
12,3264,Sawdust ?,N
13,3264,"Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on .",Y
14,3264,That makes sense .,N
15,3264,"Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting .",Y
16,3264,And I can choose any color ?,Y
17,3264,"Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir .",Y
18,3264,And after the varnish ?,Y
19,3264,"After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish .",Y
20,3264,And then ?,N
21,3264,"Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done .",N
22,3264,It all sounds very complicated .,N
23,3264,It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it .,Y
24,3264,"Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it .",Y
25,3264,"Alright , sir . __eou__",N
0,3265,How can I help you ?,N
1,3265,"Yes , I would like to look at some of your products .",N
2,3265,Did you have anything specific in mind ?,N
3,3265,"Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now.But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies .",N
4,3265,"Well , you made a good choice . Coming to us , I mean.We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .",Y
5,3265,What do you have in foundation ?,N
6,3265,Our foundation is very high quality . Only the finest ingredients.It will moisturize your skin and it has a sun block rating of 8 .,Y
7,3265,What colors do you have in foundation ?,N
8,3265,Let me show you.We have this rose color . We also have different shades of beige .,Y
9,3265,The color I use now is rose.How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle .,N
10,3265,"In this size , we sell it for 53.95 .",N
11,3265,Wow ! That's expensive .,N
12,3265,"What you're paying for , Ma'am , are the ingredients.It is a very high quality product .",N
13,3265,I understand . I need some mascara too.Do you have a good thickening mascara ?,N
14,3265,Of course . Here is our thickening mascara.We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .,Y
15,3265,Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too.Do you have a color chart I can look at ?,Y
16,3265,We have a very wide selection of colors.And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin.So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?,Y
17,3265,"Oh , sure . I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .",N
18,3265,I can help you with that .,N
19,3265,Thank you . __eou__,N
0,3266,What should I get Uncle Teddy ?,N
1,3266,You could get him a tie .,Y
2,3266,Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie .,N
3,3266,Why not ?,Y
4,3266,Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift .,Y
5,3266,"Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .",Y
6,3266,That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .,Y
7,3266,"He would think you were crazy , Caroline .",N
8,3266,"Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between .",Y
9,3266,How much do you want to spend ?,N
10,3266,"Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .",N
11,3266,"Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day .",Y
12,3266,Yes .,N
13,3266,"Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .",N
14,3266,What should he have then ?,N
15,3266,"I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .",Y
16,3266,I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ?,N
17,3266,I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street .,N
18,3266,Alright . We can go later then .,N
19,3266,"We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street .",Y
20,3266,Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?,N
21,3266,She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears .,N
22,3266,Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ?,Y
23,3266,How about the iguana ?,Y
24,3266,I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .,Y
25,3266,A tie ?,N
26,3266,"Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ?",Y
27,3266,I was just kidding . __eou__,N
0,3267,"May I help you , sir ?",N
1,3267,"Yes , I want to buy a VCR .",N
2,3267,"Well , we have many models to choose from here.Do you have a particular brand you want ?",N
3,3267,No . I only want it to be a very good one . The best.It ' s a graduation gift for my son .,Y
4,3267,I see . And does your son have a VCR now ?,N
5,3267,"Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR .",Y
6,3267,Does he watch a lot of movies ?,N
7,3267,"Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university .",N
8,3267,"I would like to make a suggestion then , sir .",Y
9,3267,Please do .,N
10,3267,"If your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself .",Y
11,3267,"Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use .",N
12,3267,May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ?,Y
13,3267,DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ?,N
14,3267,It is very similar . The technology is the same .,N
15,3267,Why is a DVD better than a VCR ?,N
16,3267,"For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital .",Y
17,3267,But isn't it more expensive ?,N
18,3267,"It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate .",Y
19,3267,What's that ?,N
20,3267,"If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long .",N
21,3267,And why not ?,Y
22,3267,"Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot .",Y
23,3267,Hmm . Is that true ?,N
24,3267,"Yes , it is , sir .",N
25,3267,Well . And what about DVDs ?,Y
26,3267,"This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot .",Y
27,3267,Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film .,Y
28,3267,"So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future .",Y
29,3267,"Alright , please show me what you have . __eou__",N

12,3279,That's a lot of money !,N
13,3279,It's worth every penny of it .,N
14,3279,"Well , I like the house , but I can't decide yet . My wife must see it first .",N
15,3279,Women always have the last word . __eou__,N
0,3280,Can I help you ?,N
1,3280,"Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here .",N
2,3280,"Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students .",Y
3,3280,I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer .,N
4,3280,"Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .",Y
5,3280,Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ?,N
6,3280,"Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ?",N
7,3280,History .,N
8,3280,"Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your",N
9,3280,Thirty percent ?,N
10,3280,Yes .,N
11,3280,Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ?,Y
12,3280,Yes . It's an excellent system .,N
13,3280,"Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ?",N
14,3280,"Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing .",N
15,3280,I don't want Macintosh . I want PC .,N
16,3280,"I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment .",N
17,3280,What ? Are you serious ?,N
18,3280,Yes .,N
19,3280,But nobody uses Macintosh !,N
20,3280,"That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma",Y
21,3280,"Yes , I'm from Taiwan .",N
22,3280,"Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used .",Y
23,3280,But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese .,Y
24,3280,There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple .,Y
25,3280,Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry .,Y
26,3280,"No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple .",N
27,3280,"Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later .",N
28,3280,"You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . __eou__",N
0,3281,I need a haircut .,N
1,3281,Do you have an appointment ?,N
2,3281,"No , I don't . You look pretty busy today . Do you have an opening for me ?",N
3,3281,"Yes , we do . I can cut your hair right now if you like.Do you need a shampoo too , or just a haircut ?",N
4,3281,Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning .,N
5,3281,Alright . I will have an assistant wet your hair . Then I can cut it.Please step over there.How would you like your hair cut today ?,N
6,3281,"Well , I last had a haircut eight weeks ago . So my hair is pretty long.But I want the same style .",N
7,3281,I recommend you leave it a little long on top.But we should take in the back and sides a bit more . That's more fashionable now .,Y
8,3281,Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation .,Y
9,3281,So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ?,N
10,3281,Fine .,N
11,3281,And do you usually part your hair along here ?,N
12,3281,Yes .,N
13,3281,"Alright , I know just what to do.Your hair seems quite dry , you know . And I see some split ends .",Y
14,3281,"Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair .",N
15,3281,The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy .,N
16,3281,I don't know what to do about it .,N
17,3281,"Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g",Y
18,3281,Do you sell conditioner here ?,N
19,3281,Of course . I have one I can suggest .,Y
20,3281,Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak .,Y
21,3281,The problem is the split ends . __eou__,Y
0,3282,I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .,Y
1,3282,We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .,Y
2,3282,"I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .",N
3,3282,We need to find a good realtor .,N
4,3282,"Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .",Y
5,3282,What do you mean ?,N
6,3282,"Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .",N
7,3282,But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .,N
8,3282,"Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .",N
9,3282,"I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has",Y
10,3282,"Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .",Y
11,3282,So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?,Y
12,3282,It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .,Y
13,3282,And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?,N
14,3282,"Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .",Y
15,3282,Why ?,N
16,3282,"Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .",Y
17,3282,Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .,N
18,3282,It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .,Y
19,3282,I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .,Y
20,3282,Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . __eou__,N
0,3283,are you good at cooking ?,N
1,3283,"no , but I'm pretty good at eating !",N
2,3283,do you prefer chinese food or Western food ?,N
3,3283,"well , to be honest with you , Chinese food is really different from western food .",Y
4,3283,are you used to the food here ?,N
5,3283,I'm not really used to it yet .,N
6,3283,what's your favorite Chinese dish ?,N
7,3283,"like most foreigners , I really like Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken . I eat them almost every day .",N
8,3283,have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ?,N
9,3283,"I tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks .",N
10,3283,"you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression .",Y
11,3283,"that's good to know . I'd like to try more Chinese food , but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food .",Y
12,3283,"if you want , I can introduce you to some typical Chinese dishes .",Y
13,3283,"that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat !",N
14,3283,"if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it ! __eou__",Y
0,3284,Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house.But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ?,Y
1,3284,"Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ?",Y
2,3284,"Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off",Y
3,3284,"Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey",N
4,3284,Can I write that down ?,Y
5,3284,"Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages .",N
6,3284,Thanks .,N
7,3284,"And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ?",Y
8,3284,What do you mean ?,N
9,3284,"I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ?",Y
10,3284,Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year .,Y
11,3284,Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart .,N
12,3284,What are those stores ?,N
13,3284,"They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom .",Y
14,3284,Even silverware ?,Y
15,3284,"Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient .",N
16,3284,I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ?,Y
17,3284,"I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store .",Y
18,3284,What does that mean ?,N
19,3284,That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics .,N
20,3284,Electronics ?,N
21,3284,Yes . Like stereos and televisions .,Y
22,3284,How much is the membership fee ?,N
23,3284,"I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all",N
24,3284,I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things .,N
25,3284,I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . __eou__,N
0,3285,May I help you ?,N
1,3285,"Yes , I would like to return these slacks .",N
2,3285,Alright . Do you have your receipt ?,N
3,3285,Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week .,N
4,3285,And why are you returning them ?,N
5,3285,I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match .,N
6,3285,"I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale .",N
7,3285,"Yes , they were thirty percent off .",N
8,3285,"I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items .",N
9,3285,I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before .,N
10,3285,"I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy .",N
11,3285,I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here.Can you make an exception this time ?,N
12,3285,"Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment.Ma ' am , the manager says I can do it this time .",N
13,3285,Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me .,N
14,3285,Please show me your receipt again .,N
15,3285,Here it is .,N
16,3285,"I will have to give you store credit , Ma'am . If you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit .",Y

0,3286,"Morgan , can I ask you a question ?",N
1,3286,"sure , what is it ?",Y
2,3286,I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant .,N
3,3286,"in most cities in China , doggie bags are quite uncommon .",Y
4,3286,what happen to all the leftover food ?,N
5,3286,it usually goes to the dump .,N
6,3286,that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ?,Y
7,3286,"ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today .",Y
8,3286,I guess that makes sense . I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home .,N
9,3286,"well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home .",Y
10,3286,"no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ...",N
11,3286,I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them .,N
12,3286,"many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK .",Y
13,3286,did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you .,Y
14,3286,"that's OK . I'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough ! __eou__",N
0,3287,"do you like cooking , Julia ?",N
1,3287,"I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good !",Y
2,3287,how often do you usually cook ?,N
3,3287,I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week .,N
4,3287,that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much .,N
5,3287,"I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply .",Y
6,3287,what kind of dishes do you usually make ?,N
7,3287,"I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays .",N
8,3287,do you make a lot of traditional British food ?,N
9,3287,"aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week .",Y
10,3287,how about spicy food ?,Y
11,3287,"my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice .",Y
12,3287,what's your favorite dish to make ?,N
13,3287,"I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it . __eou__",Y
0,3288,I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture .,N
1,3288,the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ?,Y
2,3288,"I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me .",N
3,3288,"well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ?",Y
4,3288,most some drinks have too much sugar in them .,Y
5,3288,"the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ?",N
6,3288,I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ?,N
7,3288,"unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ?",N
8,3288,I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ?,N
9,3288,maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee .,Y
10,3288,maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ?,Y
11,3288,you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup .,Y
12,3288,"that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat .",N
13,3288,"thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet . __eou__",N
0,3289,do you have any plans for dinner tonight ?,N
1,3289,"no , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ?",N
2,3289,I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ?,Y
3,3289,I'm absolutely useless at cooking !,N
4,3289,I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you !,Y
5,3289,"I know they aren't good for me , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty .",N
6,3289,I recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ?,Y
7,3289,"yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ?",Y
8,3289,"I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start !",Y
9,3289,what do we do first ?,N
10,3289,"first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .",N
11,3289,ok . Should I heat the wok ?,N
12,3289,"yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes .",Y
13,3289,what about the chicken ?,Y
14,3289,that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through .,Y
15,3289,how about the rice ?,Y
16,3289,I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?,N
17,3289,"white rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! __eou__",N

3,3290,I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears .,N
4,3290,automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .,Y
5,3290,you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat !,Y
6,3290,very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ?,N
7,3290,"I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ?",N
8,3290,how ’ s that ?,N
9,3290,that ’ s better . Now what ?,Y
10,3290,check your petrol situation .,N
11,3290,the tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up .,N
12,3290,"that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway .",Y
13,3290,I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece .,N

0,3296,"excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?",N
1,3296,"you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .",N
2,3296,that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?,N
3,3296,"it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait .",N
4,3296,can I buy stamps here ?,N
5,3296,sure . How many would you like ?,N
6,3296,I need 30 for my Christmas cards .,N
7,3296,are you sending them abroad ?,N
8,3296,twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .,N
9,3296,"do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .",Y
10,3296,no .,N
11,3296,"ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .",N
12,3296,and the bubble wrap ?,Y
13,3296,that ’ s another quid .,N
14,3296,thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful . __eou__,N
0,3297,how can I help you ?,N
1,3297,I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend .,N
2,3297,do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?,N
3,3297,she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance .,Y
4,3297,"ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes .",N
5,3297,which one would you recommend ?,N
6,3297,"personally , I quite like the new perfume by Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?",N
7,3297,"that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please .",N
8,3297,would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .,Y
9,3297,"it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy .",N
10,3297,how about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick .,Y
11,3297,she doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big .,N
12,3297,how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger .,Y
13,3297,no thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is .,N
14,3297,I know what she would like---some whitening cream .,N
15,3297,"no thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter .",N
16,3297,will that be all then ?,N
17,3297,"that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks . __eou__",N
0,3298,we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ?,N
1,3298,"yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !",N
2,3298,let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?,N
3,3298,"what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?",N
4,3298,I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .,N
5,3298,"well , let's get a plate of those then .",Y
6,3298,sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?,N
7,3298,I think I might have a dahl .,Y
8,3298,what's in a dahl ?,Y
9,3298,it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .,N
10,3298,that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?,N
11,3298,ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?,N
12,3298,that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?,N
13,3298,I think I'll have a beer .,N
14,3298,"ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?",N
15,3298,I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .,N
16,3298,you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !,N
17,3298,what would you do without me ? __eou__,N
0,3299,can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding .,Y
1,3299,sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ?,Y
2,3299,"it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend .",Y
3,3299,"that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ?",Y
4,3299,I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit .,Y
5,3299,"brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ?",Y
6,3299,haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black .,Y
7,3299,"why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything !",Y
8,3299,"that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest .",Y
9,3299,here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ?,N
10,3299,"I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler .",Y
11,3299,how about this one ?,Y
12,3299,I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made .,Y
13,3299,"ok , let's go . __eou__",N
0,3300,"alright , tell me what you think .",Y
1,3300,don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ?,Y
2,3300,"yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ?",Y
3,3300,"that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ?",N
4,3300,"no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated .",Y
5,3300,"I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own .",Y
6,3300,"how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?",Y
7,3300,that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?,Y
8,3300,that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .,N
9,3300,"thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",N
10,3300,yep . Here it is . What do you think ?,Y
11,3300,that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?,N
12,3300,the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?,N
13,3300,"no , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .",N
14,3300,that ’ s even better than the real thing .,Y
15,3300,"if I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .",Y
16,3300,it ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! __eou__,N
0,3301,it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !,N
1,3301,we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?,N
2,3301,"that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?",N
3,3301,"sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen .",N
4,3301,"that would be lovely , thanks .",N
5,3301,do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?,N
6,3301,"I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .",N
7,3301,ok . What do you think about our living room ?,N
8,3301,"well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .",N
9,3301,my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .,N
10,3301,"oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .",N
11,3301,"your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming .",N
12,3301,"I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help .",Y
13,3301,"that ’ s very nice of you to offer . Here ’ s your tea . Be careful , it ’ s still quite hot . __eou__",N
0,3302,how is your house hunting going ?,N
1,3302,not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet .,N
2,3302,how much are you looking to spend ?,N
3,3302,I can only afford about 300 pounds a month .,N
4,3302,looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .,N
5,3302,really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room .,N
6,3302,"well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price !",N
7,3302,do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ?,N
8,3302,I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ?,Y
9,3302,"I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get !",N
10,3302,how long do you want to sign a contract for ?,N
11,3302,I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that .,Y
12,3302,do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ?,N
13,3302,"I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished .",Y
14,3302,"you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?",N
15,3302,"no , I thought that would be included in the rent .",N
16,3302,"it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities .",N
17,3302,I don't think I can afford that .,N
18,3302,don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children .,Y
19,3302,that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . __eou__,Y
0,3303,"no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor .",N
1,3303,"no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !",N
2,3303,"oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !",N
3,3303,"ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?",Y
4,3303,ok ... sure . __eou__,N
0,3304,How much is this ?,N
1,3304,You mean the large one or the small one ?,N
2,3304,The large one .,N
3,3304,They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars .,N
4,3304,Is this the only kind you have ?,N
5,3304,No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ?,N
6,3304,"Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide .",Y
7,3304,Very well . Just take your time . __eou__,N
0,3305,"ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ?",N
1,3305,"I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here .",N
2,3305,what ? I don't understand .,N
3,3305,I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food ?,N
4,3305,Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' !,N
5,3305,"Huh ? What were you talking about , then ?",N
6,3305,"' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly !",Y
7,3305,"oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway ! __eou__",N
0,3306,Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ?,N
1,3306,Don't feel like it . I'm broke .,N
2,3306,"Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?",Y
3,3306,"Just look around ? Ah , that's boring .",Y
4,3306,I'll go myself then . __eou__,N
0,3307,How can I get to Lakeside Park ?,N
1,3307,Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there .,N
2,3307,Will it take me straight there ?,N
3,3307,Yes . No need to change . __eou__,N
0,3308,Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ?,N
1,3308,"Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right .",N
2,3308,"Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ?",N
3,3308,"No , it's just a couple of minutes .",N
4,3308,Thanks very much .,N
5,3308,You're welcome . __eou__,N
0,3309,have you thought of moving at all Sarah ?,Y
1,3309,"we ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do .",N
2,3309,"buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .",Y
3,3309,like what ?,N
4,3309,"well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .",Y
5,3309,that ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?,N
6,3309,"sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it .",N
7,3309,is the house pretty run-down .,N
8,3309,"not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her .",N
9,3309,was it very old house ?,N
10,3309,"it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .",N
11,3309,is it in a good location ?,N
12,3309,"the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . __eou__",Y
0,3310,it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping .,Y
1,3310,you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world .,N
2,3310,"I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything .",Y
3,3310,what kind of errands do we need to run ?,N
4,3310,"well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .",Y
5,3310,I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight .,Y
6,3310,"fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time .",Y
7,3310,"sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers .",N
8,3310,I promise . We ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for .,Y
9,3310,"ok , let ’ s go then !",N
10,3310,do you have any money ?,N
11,3310,for what ?,N
12,3310,"for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street .",Y
13,3310,you said you were only going to window shop !,N
14,3310,"I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market !",Y
15,3310,I should have known ... __eou__,N
0,3311,"Mon and I got in another fight , Boris .",N
1,3311,"oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ?",N
2,3311,it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no .,N
3,3311,I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat .,N
4,3311,"oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them .",N
5,3311,I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth .,Y
6,3311,"But , Boris , i am not a baby any more .",Y
7,3311,"well , that's true .",N
8,3311,how about your mother ?,N
9,3311,she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals .,Y
10,3311,poor you . It seems we are in the same boat .,N
11,3311,"Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit .",Y
12,3311,really ? so you don't have fried food at all .,N
13,3311,not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much .,N
14,3311,how do you manage it ?,N
15,3311,"it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat . __eou__",Y
0,3312,what shall we do after the volleyball match ?,Y
1,3312,how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .,Y
2,3312,that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .,Y
3,3312,"me , too . What did you have in mind ?",Y
4,3312,"I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .",Y
5,3312,"I agree . They're very lovely , especially "" Huan Huan "" .",N
6,3312,"is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?",N
7,3312,"the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .",Y
8,3312,"oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?",N
9,3312,I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .,N
10,3312,any other ideas ?,Y
11,3312,"there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .",Y
12,3312,it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . __eou__,Y
0,3313,good afternoon ! Can I help you ?,N
1,3313,could you show me where the Chinese-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat .,N
2,3313,"this way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade .",Y
3,3313,"oh , they look nice . May I try that back one on ?",N
4,3313,of course . The fitting room is right over there .,N
5,3313,do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .,N
6,3313,I'm sorry . All the back of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?,N
7,3313,"ok , let me try it on . what do you think ?",Y
8,3313,"oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .",Y
9,3313,"really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ?",N
10,3313,"our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .",N
11,3313,thanks . Who much would that come to ?,N
12,3313,let me see ... __eou__,N
0,3314,"Boris , look at this sentence . "" Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . "" It's interesting , isn't it ?",Y
1,3314,"I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those "" strict nutrition philosophies "" about ?",Y
2,3314,"I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories .",Y
3,3314,"Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists .",N
4,3314,Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable .,Y
5,3314,"Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .",Y
6,3314,Seriously ?,N
7,3314,"Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so .",N
8,3314,Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .,Y
9,3314,"Absolutely . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine .",Y
10,3314,But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body . __eou__,Y
0,3315,"I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ?",N
1,3315,sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?,Y

3,3315,"dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new !",Y
4,3315,"well , what do you have in mind ?",Y
5,3315,how about the Mongolian hot pot ?,Y
6,3315,"oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up !",N
7,3315,maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base .,Y
8,3315,sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well .,N
9,3315,yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines .,N
10,3315,great . Let's go !,Y
11,3315,wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . __eou__,Y
0,3316,"wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ?",N
1,3316,the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each .,N
2,3316,I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife .,N
3,3316,"absolutely . It is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day .",Y
4,3316,"incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ?",N
5,3316,"oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one .",Y
6,3316,thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste .,N
7,3316,"Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy .",N
8,3316,"oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ?",N
9,3316,"certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique",Y
10,3316,it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great .,N

1,3317,"You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?",N

5,3317,Didn't you learn that red means stop ?,N
6,3317,I know that .,N
7,3317,Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .,N

9,3317,I'm giving you a ticket for this .,N

2,3739,I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .,N
3,3739,"That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .",N

3,3743,And you think I fit the qualifications ?,N
4,3743,Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate .,Y

0,3769,"Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ?",N
1,3769,Don't brother me !,N
2,3769,"Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help .",N
3,3769,"Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault .",N
4,3769,"So , what's the problem ?",N
5,3769,I drew a blank on the algebra test .,N
6,3769,No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ?,N
7,3769,"Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test .",N
8,3769,"That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester .",N
9,3769,I'm thinking of dropping out .,N
10,3769,"You can't do that , Jenny !",N
11,3769,"I'm dead serious about this , Sally .",N
12,3769,"Come on , let's talk about it . __eou__",Y
0,3770,Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ?,N
1,3770,Really ? Why ?,N
2,3770,He had moved and held a party on July 1st .,N
3,3770,It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time .,N
4,3770,"Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends .",Y
5,3770,You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him . __eou__,Y
0,3771,"Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ?",N
1,3771,"Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others .",N
2,3771,Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ?,N
3,3771,"In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago .",N
4,3771,I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system .,Y
5,3771,I bet nobody will care about it . __eou__,N
0,3772,"Richard , why didn't you come to school today ?",N
1,3772,I'm sick . I think I've got the flu .,N
2,3772,"Well , take care of yourself . __eou__",N
0,3773,I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book .,N
1,3773,Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting . __eou__,N
0,3774,I'm frustrated .,N
1,3774,What's the problem ?,N
2,3774,I can't work out this problem .,N
3,3774,Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out .,Y
4,3774,Thanks . I really appreciate it . __eou__,N
0,3775,"Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet !",N
1,3775,Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else .,N
2,3775,You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report .,N
3,3775,"Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got .",N
4,3775,It just happened to be the highest grade in the class .,N
5,3775,You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it .,N
6,3775,I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade .,N
7,3775,If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . __eou__,Y
0,3776,Is this the A housing office ?,N
1,3776,"Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ?",N
2,3776,"I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full .",N
3,3776,"It is , but I can put you on a waiting list , if you would like .",N
4,3776,"Please . And in the mean time , can I look at apartments available in the area from this office ?",Y
5,3776,"Yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As .",N
6,3776,Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ?,N
7,3776,The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have . __eou__,N
0,3777,It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies .,N
1,3777,"Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you .",Y
2,3777,Which country do you want to go to ?,N
3,3777,My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ?,N
4,3777,"Were I in your position , I'd go to America .",Y
5,3777,Which university should I apply to ?,N
6,3777,"There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .",Y
7,3777,"Oh , I see . Thank you very much . __eou__",N
0,3778,"Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ?",N
1,3778,"More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly .",Y
2,3778,"Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ?",N
3,3778,"I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff .",N
4,3778,The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group .,Y
5,3778,I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing .,N
6,3778,Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ?,N
7,3778,"My dad was , but not my mom . __eou__",Y
0,3779,How many credits are you taking this semester ?,N
1,3779,"I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen .",N
2,3779,"What's the matter , are the classes you want full ?",N
3,3779,Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major .,Y
4,3779,"If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ?",Y
5,3779,I think with International Business a language would be appropriate .,Y
6,3779,Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ?,Y
7,3779,"As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . __eou__",Y
0,3780,"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .",N
1,3780,It's ok . What do you want to ask ?,N
2,3780,Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?,N
3,3780,The first place you should go is the International Center .,N
4,3780,Why ?,N
5,3780,You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .,Y
6,3780,What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?,N
7,3780,"They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .",Y
8,3780,Can we get any more help at the International Center ?,N
9,3780,"Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .",Y
10,3780,I see . It must be worth going to .,Y
11,3780,"Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .",Y
12,3780,Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .,Y
13,3780,"It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . __eou__",N
0,3781,"What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ?",N
1,3781,"Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot .",Y
2,3781,You are going to take courses ?,N
3,3781,Yes . I am going to take some university courses there .,N
4,3781,Sounds hard .,N
5,3781,"Yes , but I think it's probably for the best .",N
6,3781,Won't you get lonely ?,N
7,3781,"Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . __eou__",Y
0,3782,What do you think of your teacher ?,N
1,3782,He's very strict with us .,N
2,3782,And I hear he gives very good lectures .,N
3,3782,Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . __eou__,Y
0,3783,Could you tell me how to use the library ?,Y
1,3783,Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library .,Y
2,3783,How many books am I allowed to check out at a time ?,N
3,3783,"Two books at a time . Except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library .",N
4,3783,How long can I keep the books ?,N
5,3783,"For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer .",Y
6,3783,I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ?,N
7,3783,"Yes , just over there to your right .",N
8,3783,Thank you very much .,N
9,3783,You ’ re welcome . __eou__,N
0,3784,Hi . What's your name ?,N
1,3784,My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?,N
2,3784,My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .,N
3,3784,Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?,N
4,3784,No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?,N
5,3784,Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .,N
6,3784,Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?,N
7,3784,"I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .",N
8,3784,"I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .",N
9,3784,Why were you in Japan ?,N
10,3784,My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .,Y
11,3784,That's pretty cool .,N
12,3784,I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .,Y
13,3784,"Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .",Y
14,3784,"Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .",N
15,3784,Ok . __eou__,N
0,3785,"Hey John , did you register for classes yet ?",N
1,3785,I register this Friday .,N
2,3785,What classes do you plan on taking ?,N
3,3785,"I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available .",N
4,3785,Is that class really that popular ?,N
5,3785,"Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered .",N
6,3785,What other classes are you going to take ?,N
7,3785,"I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing .",N
8,3785,"I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad .",N
9,3785,Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from .,N
10,3785,I had Professor Mahoney .,N
11,3785,Is he an easy grader ?,N
12,3785,"I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair .",N
13,3785,Do you mind if I ask you what you got ?,N
14,3785,Not at all . I got a 3.8 .,N
15,3785,"Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ?",N
16,3785,I got a 4.0 in that class .,N
17,3785,"Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder .",N
18,3785,"It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade .",Y
19,3785,Oh . That helps . Thanks . __eou__,N
0,3786,Did you get your grades yet ?,N
1,3786,Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now .,N
2,3786,Why ? What happened ?,N
3,3786,"Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 .",N
4,3786,Ouch . You must be very disappointed .,N
5,3786,"Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have .",N
6,3786,Why don't you re-take the class next year ?,N
7,3786,That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ?,N
8,3786,I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 .,N
9,3786,My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class .,N
10,3786,What was your GPA before this semester ?,N
11,3786,I was sitting happy with a 3.4 .,N
12,3786,Why did it go down so much ?,N
13,3786,Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class .,N
14,3786,What happened to you ?,N
15,3786,I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time .,N
16,3786,You better stop slacking off .,N
17,3786,You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . __eou__,N
0,3787,Hi Mark .,N
1,3787,"Oh , hi Stacy .",N
2,3787,How was your summer vacation ?,N
3,3787,"I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ?",N
4,3787,I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up .,N
5,3787,So are you officially a junior now ?,N
6,3787,"Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same .",Y
7,3787,That makes sense . So where is Nicole ?,N
8,3787,She dropped out of school completely .,N
9,3787,Really ? Why ?,N
10,3787,"She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time .",Y
11,3787,Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job .,N
12,3787,"It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer .",N
13,3787,Do you know how much they are paying her ?,N
14,3787,"I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . __eou__",N
0,3788,"Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ?",N
1,3788,You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful .,N
2,3788,Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ?,N
3,3788,No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way .,N
4,3788,Did you register yet ?,N
5,3788,Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss .,N
6,3788,What classes do you think are still open ?,N
7,3788,"Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology .",Y
8,3788,That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester .,Y
9,3788,"I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full .",Y
10,3788,He does that ?,N
11,3788,I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class .,N
12,3788,That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help .,N
13,3788,"No problem , man . __eou__",N
0,3789,Did you already take the history exam ?,N
1,3789,Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?,N
2,3789,I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?,Y
3,3789,Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .,Y
4,3789,What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?,Y
5,3789,I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .,N
6,3789,"Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .",N
7,3789,"If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .",Y
8,3789,Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .,N
9,3789,Good luck .,N
10,3789,Thanks . See ya . __eou__,N
0,3790,Can I help you ?,N
1,3790,"Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ?",N
2,3790,These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful .,Y
3,3790,Can I check this one out ?,N
4,3790,"I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it .",N
5,3790,Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out .,N
6,3790,All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday .,N
7,3790,Thanks for your help . __eou__,N
0,3791,"Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ?",N
1,3791,It was great ! How was your year ?,N
2,3791,It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ?,N
3,3791,"Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda . __eou__",N
0,3792,"Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ?",N
1,3792,No . I caught a cold two days ago . I only finish reading half of it .,N
2,3792,I'm sorry to hear that . How are you feeling now ?,N
3,3792,I'm feeling better today .,N
4,3792,How many days do you plan to finish reading it ?,N
5,3792,"About more three days , I think .",N
6,3792,"OK . After three days , I will come to you for it .",N
7,3792,No problem . __eou__,N
0,3793,You'd better prepare for the examination .,N
1,3793,I don't think the exam will be very hard .,N
2,3793,"You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course .",N
3,3793,Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . __eou__,Y
0,3794,"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?",N
1,3794,"I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?",Y
2,3794,I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .,N
3,3794,"Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .",N
4,3794,"Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .",Y
5,3794,"But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?",Y
6,3794,"Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .",N
7,3794,"I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?",N
8,3794,"That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .",Y
9,3794,Really ?,N
10,3794,Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .,N
11,3794,Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?,N
12,3794,Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .,N
13,3794,How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?,Y
14,3794,"That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .",Y
15,3794,"So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?",Y
16,3794,"Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .",Y
17,3794,Why did they want to found a college ?,N
18,3794,Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .,Y
19,3794,"Oh , I see .",N
20,3794,"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .",Y
21,3794,When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?,N
22,3794,"In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .",N
23,3794,It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .,Y
24,3794,"Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .",N
25,3794,"Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .",Y
26,3794,Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .,Y
27,3794,I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .,N
28,3794,Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .,Y
29,3794,That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .,N
30,3794,You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__,Y
0,3795,Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ?,N
1,3795,They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class .,N
2,3795,Would you consider it your favorite class ?,N
3,3795,"I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there .",N
4,3795,What class was your favorite then ?,N
5,3795,I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific .,N
6,3795,"I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . __eou__",Y
0,3796,Did you ever take History 231 ?,N
1,3796,Yeah . Last semester .,N
2,3796,Who was the professor ?,N
3,3796,It was Professor Johnson .,N
4,3796,I have him this semester . What do you think about him ?,N
5,3796,"He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader .",N
6,3796,What did you end up getting ?,N
7,3796,"I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade .",N
8,3796,That's probably because he grades on a curve .,N
9,3796,Are you enjoying the class so far ?,N
10,3796,"I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out .",N
11,3796,Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot .,Y
12,3796,Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . __eou__,N
0,3797,Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ?,N
1,3797,It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out .,N
2,3797,Why ? What's stressing you out ?,N
3,3797,"School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out .",N
4,3797,The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright .,Y
5,3797,I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take .,N
6,3797,I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other .,Y
7,3797,That will be great . __eou__,N
0,3798,Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry .,N
1,3798,Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there .,N
2,3798,What are you going to play ?,N
3,3798,Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball .,Y

5,3799,I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .,N
6,3799,"Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?",Y
7,3799,That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .,Y
8,3799,"I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .",Y
9,3799,And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .,Y

1,3800,"I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ?",Y
2,3800,"That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account .",Y
3,3800,It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing .,Y
4,3800,"You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . __eou__",Y
0,3801,"It's a sunny day , isn't it ?",N

4,3803,It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten .,N
5,3803,Well . I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam .,N
6,3803,Why are you so pessimistic ?,N
7,3803,I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad .,N
8,3803,I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . Don't lose your heart .,Y
9,3803,Thank you . That's very nice of you . __eou__,N

1,3820,"Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester .",N
2,3820,I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class .,N
3,3820,I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class .,N
4,3820,"Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages .",Y
5,3820,"Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses .",Y

9,3820,"Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note .",N

14,3820,"I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note .",N
15,3820,You can count on me . __eou__,N

1,3824,Morning . Can I help you ?,N
2,3824,"Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here .",N
3,3824,All you need is your student identification card to check out books .,N
4,3824,Yes . Here's my identification .,N
5,3824,That's all you need .,N
6,3824,"Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ?",N
7,3824,"You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library .",N
8,3824,How long can I keep the books ?,N
9,3824,For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer .,Y
10,3824,I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ?,N
11,3824,"Yes , over there to your left . __eou__",N

1,3826,"Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent .",N
2,3826,"Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ?",Y
3,3826,"In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described .",N
4,3826,It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ?,Y
5,3826,You'll get used to it gradually .,N
6,3826,"Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ?",N
7,3826,"Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months .",N
8,3826,Three months ? Incredible ! __eou__,N
0,3827,I am certain I am going to fail my English test .,N
1,3827,Why are you so pessimistic ?,N
2,3827,Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week .,N
3,3827,Only for this reason ?,N
4,3827,"Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad .",N
5,3827,"Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation .",Y

0,3828,How do I apply to an American university ?,N
1,3828,"You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one .",Y
2,3828,I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .,N
3,3828,"That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars .",N
4,3828,What's to come next ?,Y
5,3828,"If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing .",Y
6,3828,How long will it take to go over all the procedures ?,N

1,3832,Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ?,N
2,3832,I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ?,N
3,3832,"Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .",Y
4,3832,Which is better ?,N
5,3832,One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers .,Y
6,3832,I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools .,N

14,3835,"The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class .",Y

7,3836,"No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition .",N
8,3836,Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet .,Y
9,3836,"No , I thought I would take it later .",N
10,3836,"Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later .",Y
11,3836,"Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets .",Y
12,3836,"Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11",N
13,3836,I can take it then . I have that time slot free .,N
14,3836,Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher .,Y
15,3836,I'll take it then .,N
16,3836,"Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ?",Y
17,3836,"I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it .",Y
18,3836,Really ? That's great to know .,N
19,3836,That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . __eou__,Y
0,3837,"Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ?",N
1,3837,"Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ?",Y
2,3837,Alright . Do you have a coin ?,N
3,3837,"Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air .",N
4,3837,Heads .,N
5,3837,"Sorry , it's tails . You lose .",N
6,3837,"Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one .",Y
7,3837,Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ?,N
8,3837,"No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room .",N
9,3837,Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there .,Y
10,3837,"Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ?",Y
11,3837,"Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ?",Y
12,3837,"Yes , I agree .",N
13,3837,"So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair .",Y
14,3837,Alright .,N
15,3837,"I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls .",N
16,3837,Is that right ?,N
17,3837,"Yes , that's right .",N
18,3837,"Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you .",Y
19,3837,"Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave .",Y
20,3837,Are all lucky people so stuck up ?,N
21,3837,"C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding .",N
22,3837,"Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it .",N
23,3837,Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ?,Y
24,3837,"I will go get something to eat . You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack .",N
25,3837,Alright . See you later . __eou__,N
0,3838,"How can I help you today , Alice ?",N
1,3838,"Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship .",N
2,3838,"Oh , good . You're an excellent student . I'd be very willing to help you with that .",N
3,3838,"Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship .",N
4,3838,What kind of scholarship is it ?,N
5,3838,It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American .,Y
6,3838,"Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher .",N
7,3838,"I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 .",N
8,3838,Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it .,N
9,3838,"Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too .",N
10,3838,Do you have an essay you want to send them ?,N
11,3838,"No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose .",N
12,3838,What is the question ?,N
13,3838,"They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced .",N
14,3838,That's a pretty short essay .,N
15,3838,"Yes , but I need to write it by next week .",N
16,3838,Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job .,N
17,3838,"I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors .",N
18,3838,Sure . What are they ?,Y
19,3838,"First , I need a letter of recommendation .",N
20,3838,I'd be happy to write one for you .,Y
21,3838,"And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal .",N
22,3838,What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ?,N
23,3838,"Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions .",Y
24,3838,Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon .,N
25,3838,I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning .,Y
26,3838,"Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend .",N
27,3838,That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful .,N
28,3838,Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . __eou__,N
0,3839,Can I help you ?,N
1,3839,"Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ?",N
2,3839,These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful .,Y
3,3839,Can I check this one out ?,N
4,3839,"I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it .",N
5,3839,Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out .,N
6,3839,All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday .,N
7,3839,Thanks for your help . __eou__,N
0,3840,Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ?,N
1,3840,"Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .",N
2,3840,It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .,N
3,3840,Are you Chinese ?,N
4,3840,"Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science .",N
5,3840,How do you like it ?,N
6,3840,I like it so far . But my English still needs work .,N
7,3840,I want to study Mandarin and international relations .,Y
8,3840,Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?,N
9,3840,They teach regular characters .,N
10,3840,"I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified .",N
11,3840,"You just said your English needs work , yes ?",N
12,3840,"Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes .",N
13,3840,"Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange .",Y
14,3840,You mean you and I ?,Y
15,3840,"Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English .",Y
16,3840,That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ?,Y
17,3840,Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange .,Y
18,3840,How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ?,N
19,3840,"First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese .",Y
20,3840,Would I help you with writing ?,Y
21,3840,"No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes .",Y
22,3840,I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ?,N
23,3840,"Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11",N
24,3840,"Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1",Y
25,3840,So if you want to meet at 10,N
26,3840,It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on .,N
27,3840,And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own .,Y
28,3840,Let me give you my phone number .,N
29,3840,Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason . __eou__,Y
0,3841,Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it .,N
1,3841,Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed .,N
2,3841,"Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important .",N
3,3841,Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ?,N
4,3841,Yes .,N
5,3841,"But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ?",N
6,3841,What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough .,N
7,3841,"I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it !",N
8,3841,"I know , but I listened .",N
9,3841,"Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember .",N
10,3841,I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down .,N
11,3841,"There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down .",Y
12,3841,"That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot .",N
13,3841,"Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard .",Y
14,3841,Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . __eou__,Y
0,3842,You know ... I did very poorly on that test .,N
1,3842,Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more .,Y
2,3842,"Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist .",N
3,3842,"Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school . __eou__",N
0,3843,Can I help you ?,N
1,3843,"Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit .",N
2,3843,Are you a professor ?,N
3,3843,What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old !,N
4,3843,"Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ?",N
5,3843,"Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well .",N
6,3843,"Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know .",N
7,3843,It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk .,N
8,3843,Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university .,N
9,3843,My permission letter ?,N
10,3843,"Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place .",Y
11,3843,I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office .,N
12,3843,Yes . Or you can bring it yourself .,Y
13,3843,But I asked them to send it to you directly .,N
14,3843,Let me look in the file then . Maybe we received it .,N
15,3843,"My name is Derek Schneider , S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R .",N
16,3843,"Yes , here it is.Alright . Then I just need your completed application form , and I will be able to process your request .",N
17,3843,"Good . I will sit over there and fill out the form . I will give it to you in a few minutes.Oh , by the way , can I apply for any parking lot I want ?",N
18,3843,The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening .,Y
19,3843,I see . Thank you .,N
20,3843,You're very welcome . __eou__,N
0,3844,"I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester .",N
1,3844,Have you tried university part-time jobs ?,Y
2,3844,What do you mean ?,N
3,3844,"I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions .",Y
4,3844,"Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ?",N
5,3844,"Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America .",N
6,3844,I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .,Y
7,3844,"Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York .",Y
8,3844,But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least .,N
9,3844,I have an idea .,Y
10,3844,What ?,N
11,3844,"Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown .",N
12,3844,I already had that idea .,N
13,3844,"Well , why don't you go and look down there ?",Y
14,3844,But I don't know what I would do .,N
15,3844,"It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary .",Y
16,3844,Maybe . I don't know .,Y
17,3844,I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something .,Y
18,3844,I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . __eou__,Y
0,3845,Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card .,Y
1,3845,Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute .,N
2,3845,Do you know about the Bucky Card ?,N
3,3845,"I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it .",N
4,3845,"The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies .",Y
5,3845,What about beer ?,Y
6,3845,"The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee .",Y
7,3845,That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ?,N
8,3845,Usually it's two dollars off the cover price .,N
9,3845,"And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ?",N
10,3845,This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money !,Y
11,3845,"Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ?",N
12,3845,It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card .,N
13,3845,Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper .,N
14,3845,But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year .,Y
15,3845,"Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form . __eou__",N
0,3846,Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you !,N
1,3846,Thanks . __eou__,N
0,3847,I didn't see you at Mr . Johnson's class today .,N
1,3847,"Yeah , I quit .",N
2,3847,Why ?,N
3,3847,I'm fed up with his boring lectures . __eou__,N
0,3848,Do you mind if I sit here ?,N
1,3848,"Of course not , help yourself .",N
2,3848,What are you studying ?,N
3,3848,I have a test tomorrow . __eou__,N
0,3849,Bonjour !,N
1,3849,What ?,N
2,3849,"I said , Bonjour !",N
3,3849,"What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ?",N
4,3849,I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ?,N
5,3849,What ’ s wrong with speaking English ?,N
6,3849,"Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed !",N
7,3849,What are you doing that for ?,N
8,3849,I ’ m trying to learn new skills . It makes me more qualified for a good job .,Y
9,3849,Good for you . __eou__,N
0,3850,"The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ...",N
1,3850,"Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you .",N
2,3850,Sure . 7 is B . Any others ?,N
3,3850,"No , thank you . __eou__",N
0,3851,I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades .,N
1,3851,I wouldn't count on it .,N
2,3851,She did last time .,N
3,3851,"Yes , but I'll bet she won't again . __eou__",N
0,3852,Maybe you should talk to the teacher .,Y
1,3852,"No , it's no use .",N
2,3852,You never know unless you try .,Y
3,3852,I know . She won't change my grade . __eou__,N
0,3853,You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself .,N
1,3853,"Sure , what gives ?",N
2,3853,Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class !,N
3,3853,On the level ?,N
4,3853,"I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating .",N
5,3853,That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning .,N
6,3853,It serves her right ! __eou__,N
0,3854,"Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ?",N
1,3854,Hi . I ’ m calling about your continuing education program .,N
2,3854,What would you like to know ?,N
3,3854,I want to become certified in computer programming . Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education ?,Y
4,3854,"Yes , we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects .",Y
5,3854,How do I sign up ?,N
6,3854,"If you give me your address , I can mail you an information packet and the application forms .",N
7,3854,Great ! __eou__,N
0,3855,"Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine .",N
1,3855,"Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading .",N
2,3855,You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library .,Y
3,3855,"Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet .",Y
4,3855,Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ?,N
5,3855,No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice .,N
6,3855,"Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world .",Y
7,3855,"I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages .",Y
8,3855,So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics .,Y
9,3855,That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . __eou__,Y
0,3856,What ’ s your schedule like this year ?,N
1,3856,Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year .,N
2,3856,What ’ s your major ?,N
3,3856,I ’ m majoring in French literature .,N
4,3856,"Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long .",N
5,3856,That ’ s right . We got the assignment last week .,N
6,3856,When is it due ?,N
7,3856,Next Monday !,N
8,3856,Remind me never to sign up for that course ! __eou__,N
0,3857,I wanna register for this mathematics course .,N
1,3857,I ’ m sorry registration has closed .,N
2,3857,Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes .,N
3,3857,"Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ?",N
4,3857,Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee .,N
5,3857,She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ?,N
6,3857,She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is .,N
7,3857,"Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine .",Y
8,3857,Serious ? Only the proof of my address .,N
9,3857,"Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information .",N
10,3857,But it ’ s unfair .,N
11,3857,"Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can .",N
12,3857,Great .,N
13,3857,Don ’ t get your hopes up . __eou__,N
0,3858,Are you planning on studying abroad ?,N
1,3858,"I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . __eou__",Y
0,3859,"Good afternoon , everyone . The experiment is to start at 3 . Have you gone through the instructions ?",N
1,3859,"Yes , sir .",N
2,3859,"Ok , now some points for attention . First of all , pay attention to safety ... Now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . If there is any question , just let me know .",N
3,3859,"Excuse me , sir . This air compressor doesn't work .",N
4,3859,Have you turned it on ?,N
5,3859,"Yes , I have .",N

5,3882,Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count .,N
6,3882,That sounds smart ... but kind of boring .,N
7,3882,"Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends .",Y

4,3885,"Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight .",N

1,3887,We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display .,Y
2,3887,Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ?,Y
3,3887,"If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend .",Y
4,3887,"Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities .",Y
5,3887,Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives .,Y
6,3887,We could have another on the successes of graduates from here .,Y
7,3887,"I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that .",Y
8,3887,"That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university .",Y
9,3887,I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni .,Y
10,3887,A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film .,Y

0,3889,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?",N

4,3890,"True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language .",N
5,3890,A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?,Y
6,3890,One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .,Y
7,3890,No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__,N

6,3891,That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ?,N

9,3891,She said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of America .,N
10,3891,Were you able to understand everything that she said ?,N

12,3891,She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ?,N
13,3891,Yes ... with flying colors !,N
14,3891,What does that mean ?,N
15,3891,"It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well !",Y
16,3891,"If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will .",Y
17,3891,I hope so .,N
18,3891,did she give you any homework ?,N
19,3891,"not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework ,",N
20,3891,no wonder you like the class so much . __eou__,N

11,3892,Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .,N
12,3892,Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ?,N
13,3892,"Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .",N
14,3892,Do you know what she is doing now ?,N
15,3892,"As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book .",Y

2,3893,"I hope so . You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .",N
3,3893,"Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though .",Y
4,3893,"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . __eou__",Y
0,3894,Who's that over here ?,N
1,3894,That's the new teacher .,N
2,3894,What do you think of the teacher ?,N

5,3915,I'm sorry - I still don't understand .,N
6,3915,"You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve .",Y
7,3915,"So , will I be able to find this book ?",N
8,3915,"Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it .",Y
9,3915,Okay . Thank you . I understand now .,N

3,3930,"That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy .",Y
4,3930,And when do you prepare for your final exam ?,N
5,3930,"Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam .",N
6,3930,Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ?,N
7,3930,"Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them .",Y
8,3930,"Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart !",N
9,3930,But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late .,N

8,3931,When is your Adult College Entrance Exam ?,N

0,3932,So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ?,Y

3,3932,"I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't .",N
4,3932,"Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important .",Y
5,3932,"That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week .",N
6,3932,"Oh , God , I've forgotten it .",N
7,3932,"You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you .",Y
8,3932,"Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you .",N

10,3932,Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ?,N
11,3932,"It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us .",Y
12,3932,So you just talk all the time ?,N

3,3935,"You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old .",N
4,3935,No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again .,N
5,3935,"One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished .",N

7,3935,"He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then .",N
8,3935,"He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ?",N
9,3935,Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects .,Y

2,3937,Can you give us an example ?,Y
3,3937,I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information .,N
4,3937,What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ?,Y

7,3942,Sometimes it's difficult.Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__,Y
0,3943,"Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English .",Y
1,3943,You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .,Y

6,4000,Can you tell me about the other class ?,N
7,4000,It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday .,N
8,4000,You're positive that these are the only classes left ?,N
9,4000,These two are the only ones .,N
10,4000,The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine .,N
11,4000,Very good . __eou__,N
0,4001,You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English .,N
1,4001,"Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ?",N
2,4001,What's your method of learning ?,Y
3,4001,Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice .,Y
4,4001,"What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ?",Y
5,4001,"Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , than the other .",Y
6,4001,That's a good idea . You are really creative . __eou__,N
0,4002,Could you help me ?,Y
1,4002,What do you need ?,N
2,4002,I can't seem to find my class .,N
3,4002,What building is it in ?,N
4,4002,It's in the C building .,N
5,4002,"Oh , I know exactly where that is .",N
6,4002,Do you think you can tell me where it is ?,N
7,4002,"Sure , what room number is it ?",N
8,4002,It's room number 261 .,N
9,4002,I have a class around there right now .,N
10,4002,Could you show me where it is ?,N
11,4002,"No problem , come on . __eou__",N
0,4003,My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German .,Y
1,4003,What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with !,Y
2,4003,The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English .,N
3,4003,"Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too .",Y
4,4003,That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga .,N
5,4003,Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English .,Y
6,4003,That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ?,Y
7,4003,"I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! __eou__",Y
0,4004,I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it .,Y
1,4004,You did ?,N
2,4004,Yes . But now I ’ Ve learned differently . Now I have a more realistic opinion .,Y
3,4004,What do you think now ?,N
4,4004,"There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ’ t so much money after all .",Y
5,4004,But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do .,N
6,4004,That ’ s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different . __eou__,Y
0,4005,How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ?,N
1,4005,It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies .,Y
2,4005,You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding !,N
3,4005,I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time .,Y
4,4005,So do we have to stay in this English class forever ?,N
5,4005,No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation .,N
6,4005,"So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language .",Y
7,4005,You said it . __eou__,N
0,4006,How are you doing with your English Language studies ?,N
1,4006,I think I'm making good progress .,N
2,4006,Is it harder than you thought ?,N
3,4006,"At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun . __eou__",Y
0,4007,I have a real problem when I meet people .,N
1,4007,What is it ? Maybe I can help .,Y
2,4007,I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ?,Y
3,4007,Do you come from a country where they shake hands ?,N
4,4007,"Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time .",Y
5,4007,"It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t .",N
6,4007,"But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too .",Y
7,4007,"Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do .",N
8,4007,That sounds easy enough .,N
9,4007,"Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . __eou__",N
0,4008,"What do you think is harder , reading or writing ?",N
1,4008,"Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active .",Y
2,4008,I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ?,N
3,4008,"In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page .",Y
4,4008,"Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !",Y
5,4008,A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ?,Y
6,4008,I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it .,N
7,4008,Exactly .,N
8,4008,"So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?",N
9,4008,They ’ re both harder than reading or writing .,N
10,4008,In what way ?,N
11,4008,"Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English .",Y
12,4008,You are making me feel really discouraged .,N
13,4008,"I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! __eou__",N
0,4009,"I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ?",Y
1,4009,I don ’ t know . What do you think ?,Y
2,4009,"I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn .",Y
3,4009,What do natives get ?,Y
4,4009,"They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity .",Y
5,4009,Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ?,N
6,4009,"Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken .",N
7,4009,I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities .,Y
8,4009,Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . __eou__,Y
0,4010,Do you mind if I ask you a question ?,N
1,4010,"No , not at all . Go ahead .",N
2,4010,What do you do in order to improve your English ?,Y
3,4010,"I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get .",Y
4,4010,"It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ?",Y
5,4010,Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension .,Y
6,4010,"It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ?",N
7,4010,It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__,Y
0,4011,Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ?,N
1,4011,I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market .,Y
2,4011,So you will continue to study for a master's degree ?,N
3,4011,"Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home .",Y
4,4011,How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad .,Y
5,4011,"I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship .",Y
6,4011,It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... __eou__,Y
0,4012,"Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale .",N
1,4012,"I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese .",N
2,4012,"Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well .",Y
3,4012,"You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress !",Y
4,4012,Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs .,Y
5,4012,So you're learning Chinese songs ?,N
6,4012,You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now .,Y
7,4012,That's a real achievement . How did you do that ?,N
8,4012,I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer .,N
9,4012,It makes sense .,N
10,4012,It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow .,Y
11,4012,"Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try .",Y
12,4012,Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now .,Y
13,4012,Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ?,Y
14,4012,"Yes , just in case we run into me new characters .",Y
15,4012,Ok . I will bring it with me . __eou__,N
0,4013,How's your time spent in the United States ?,N
1,4013,"Well , pretty good .",N
2,4013,I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ?,N
3,4013,"Well , the cultural differences impressed me most .",Y
4,4013,You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ?,Y
5,4013,"That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question .",Y
6,4013,That's weird .,N
7,4013,"And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible .",N
8,4013,You really cared about your friend .,Y
9,4013,Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' .,N
10,4013,I'm confused . Why did he say that ?,N
11,4013,"I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind .",Y
12,4013,Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . __eou__,N
0,4014,"Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ?",Y
1,4014,"Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ?",Y
2,4014,"Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do !",N
3,4014,Did you bow back ?,N
4,4014,"No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended .",N
5,4014,"Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake .",Y
6,4014,But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ?,N
7,4014,"Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude .",Y
8,4014,Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ?,N
9,4014,"I think it's highly possible , yes .",Y
10,4014,The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country .,Y
11,4014,"That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone .",Y
12,4014,That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . __eou__,N
0,4015,How long have you been in America ?,N
1,4015,For more than five years .,N
2,4015,Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ?,N
3,4015,It's no picnic . __eou__,N
0,4016,Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?,N
1,4016,"Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .",N
2,4016,What ?,N
3,4016,"I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...",Y
4,4016,What is it ?,N
5,4016,Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .,Y
6,4016,That makes you feel uncomfortable ?,N
7,4016,Yeah . we never do that in a public office .,N
8,4016,Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .,Y
9,4016,"I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .",Y
10,4016,"Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .",Y
11,4016,Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?,N
12,4016,Yeah .,N
13,4016,"Oh , I'm shocked . __eou__",N
0,4017,Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ?,N
1,4017,"Sure , here you are .",N
2,4017,"Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?",N
3,4017,"Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better .",N
4,4017,"Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .",Y
5,4017,"Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy .",Y
6,4017,"Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes .",Y
7,4017,"I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt .",Y
8,4017,"Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . '",N
9,4017,Exactly . __eou__,N
0,4018,"Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia .",N
1,4018,"Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan .",N
2,4018,To me English is a difficult language .,N
3,4018,A second language is always difficult .,N
4,4018,"True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language .",N
5,4018,A crazy language ? Why do you say that ?,Y
6,4018,One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .,Y
7,4018,No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__,N
0,4019,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?",N
1,4019,"Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .",N
2,4019,I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?,N
3,4019,Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .,Y
4,4019,It must be interesting to study English .,Y
5,4019,Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .,N
6,4019,Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?,N
7,4019,Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__,Y
0,4020,What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .,N
1,4020,"Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .",N
2,4020,"Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?",N
3,4020,He asked me how long it took me to learn English .,N
4,4020,"But , you were born and raised in California !",N
5,4020,"Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .",Y
6,4020,What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?,N
7,4020,"You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .",Y
8,4020,"So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?",N
9,4020,"I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .",N
10,4020,Are you sure he really got the message ?,N
11,4020,"Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .",N
12,4020,That's hilarious ! What did he say ?,N
13,4020,"He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .",N
14,4020,I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . __eou__,N
0,4021,"You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic .",N
1,4021,Where did you get that idea ?,N
2,4021,"That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other .",Y
3,4021,"Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me .",N
4,4021,Is it true or isn ’ t it ?,N
5,4021,Do you want to know something about the American character ?,Y
6,4021,I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead .,N
7,4021,"No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age .",Y
8,4021,"OK , go on .",N
9,4021,"After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ?",Y
10,4021,"Not exactly , but I see your point .",N
11,4021,"I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . __eou__",Y
0,4022,What do you like to do with your free time ?,N
1,4022,Study English .,Y
2,4022,You mean you like to study English ? Why ?,Y
3,4022,It gives me great satisfaction .,N
4,4022,Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work .,N
5,4022,I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . __eou__,N
0,4023,"Hey , your Chinese is coming along !",Y
1,4023,You think ?,N
2,4023,Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine .,N
3,4023,But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy .,N
4,4023,Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . __eou__,N
0,4024,"Eric , how long will you be in China ?",N
1,4024,"I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while .",Y
2,4024,"Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ?",Y
3,4024,"Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out .",N
4,4024,Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy .,Y
5,4024,You hit the nail right on the head .,N
6,4024,"Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ?",N
7,4024,What is it ?,N
8,4024,"It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English .",Y
9,4024,Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ?,Y
10,4024,How about this sunday ?,N
11,4024,"Ok , cool .",N
12,4024,Good . I'll give you a call tonight .,N
13,4024,No problem .,N
14,4024,Bye . __eou__,N
0,4025,Are you studying any languages here ?,N
1,4025,"Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department .",N
2,4025,What are you majoring in ?,N
3,4025,I'm majoring in English .,N
4,4025,Is it difficult to learn ?,N
5,4025,"Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting .",N
6,4025,Do you know anything about Britain and America ?,N
7,4025,I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture .,Y
8,4025,Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well .,Y
9,4025,You're right . __eou__,N
0,4026,"Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English .",Y
1,4026,You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you .,Y
2,4026,"I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .",N
3,4026,"Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though .",Y
4,4026,"You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . __eou__",Y
0,4027,Are there many idioms in English ?,Y
1,4027,There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .,Y
2,4027,Can you give us an example ?,Y
3,4027,I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information .,Y
4,4027,What about the expression Goodbye ? Is that an idiom ?,N
5,4027,"That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages .",Y
6,4027,"This is interesting , Ms.Parker . __eou__",Y
0,4028,Here's the course description guide .,N
1,4028,What do I do with it ?,N
2,4028,Do you want me to help you ?,N
3,4028,Please .,N
4,4028,Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .,N
5,4028,So I don't have to worry about them .,N
6,4028,"You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...",Y
7,4028,I'll take home economics .,N
8,4028,Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself . __eou__,Y
0,4029,"Excuse me , I need your assistance .",N
1,4029,"Sure , what's up ?",N
2,4029,I have no idea where my class is .,N
3,4029,Tell me which building it's in .,N
4,4029,My class is in the C building .,N
5,4029,I know where the C building is .,N
6,4029,Do you mind telling me where it is ?,N
7,4029,"Of course , which room number is it ?",N
8,4029,Number 261 .,N
9,4029,I actually have a class right around there .,N
10,4029,Can you please show me ?,N
11,4029,I can do that . __eou__,N
0,4030,How are your Chinese lessons going ?,N
1,4030,Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English .,N
2,4030,Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier .,Y
3,4030,"Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese .",Y
4,4030,"Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier .",N

8,4151,"I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . __eou__",Y
0,4152,What are you reading ?,N
1,4152,It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language .,Y
2,4152,It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language .,Y
3,4152,"Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan – so beginning again",Y
4,4152,Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ?,Y
5,4152,"The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . __eou__",Y
0,4153,I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !,N
1,4153,"Why not ! It ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels .",Y
2,4153,But it ’ s so old .,N
3,4153,Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ?,Y
4,4153,"No , not at all .",N
5,4153,"First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century .",Y
6,4153,I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ?,N
7,4153,It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .,Y
8,4153,Why does he want to do that ?,N
9,4153,"Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for .",Y
10,4153,Won ’ t they get his inheritance ?,N
11,4153,"No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .",Y
12,4153,I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .,Y
13,4153,"So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?",N
14,4153,There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that !,N
15,4153,That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first .,N
16,4153,It would take a lot less time ..,Y
17,4153,How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you .,Y
18,4153,Ok . That sounds like a deal . __eou__,N
0,4154,What are you reading about in that science magazine ?,N
1,4154,There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning .,Y
2,4154,I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing .,N
3,4154,"According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human .",Y
4,4154,"In the future , that could be possible .",Y
5,4154,"In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original !",Y
6,4154,Really ? What else have you discovered ?,Y
7,4154,"I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune",Y
8,4154,"That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . __eou__",Y
0,4155,"Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ?",N
1,4155,"Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section .",N
2,4155,"Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this",Y
3,4155,Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ?,Y
4,4155,It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done .,Y
5,4155,It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home !,N
6,4155,"It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b",N
7,4155,Is that better ?,N
8,4155,"Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ?",N
9,4155,Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make .,N
10,4155,"That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__",Y
0,4156,Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students !,N
1,4156,"Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester .",Y
2,4156,"That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian ,",Y
3,4156,"That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o",Y
4,4156,"Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture .",Y
5,4156,"I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes .",N
6,4156,Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .,N
7,4156,I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese .,N
8,4156,"Well , there is that , yes . __eou__",Y
0,4157,"Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ?",N
1,4157,I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross .,N
2,4157,Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ?,Y
3,4157,"For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR !",Y
4,4157,Have you treated any real emergencies ?,N
5,4157,"Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense !",N
6,4157,"I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! __eou__",N
0,4158,Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester .,N
1,4158,"Yes , of course . I need your student ID please .",N
2,4158,Here you are .,N
3,4158,"Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ?",N
4,4158,Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .,Y
5,4158,Sure.That ’ s not a problem.Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ?,N
6,4158,Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .,N
7,4158,"Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ?",Y
8,4158,"Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .",Y
9,4158,"Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . __eou__",N
0,4159,What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good .,N
1,4159,"Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer !",N
2,4159,"I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .",Y
3,4159,"Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe .",N
4,4159,A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me .,N
5,4159,It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff .,Y
6,4159,"Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says .",Y
7,4159,"Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ?",N
8,4159,"There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH !",Y
9,4159,"Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ?",N
10,4159,"Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__",N
0,4160,"Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?",Y
1,4160,Cinct de mayo ?,N
2,4160,"No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .",N

4,4160,"No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .",N
5,4160,"Www , man !",N
6,4160,"In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .",N
7,4160,Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?,N
8,4160,"Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .",Y

2,4161,That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .,N
3,4161,What does that mean ?,N
4,4161,"Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer .",Y
5,4161,Me ! Me !,N
6,4161,"Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .",N
7,4161,"Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this !",N
8,4161,Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency .,Y
9,4161,"Well , OK . But no French kissing !",N
10,4161,"As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .",Y

3,4258,Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy .,Y
4,4258,And her voice like a lark's song ?,Y
5,4258,"Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song .",Y
6,4258,"Oh , she sings too ?",N

5,4260,I got it on sale down at the department store .,N
6,4260,When did you go there ?,N

5,4274,"Yes , they say I would get a big sum .",N
6,4274,Have you discussed it with your wife ?,N

3,4275,Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers .,Y
4,4275,But this chance is really precious .,Y

1,4287,Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks .,N
2,4287,She is a barking dog . But she means well .,N
3,4287,But I don ’ t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do .,N
4,4287,You are unfair to her . She is a very nice girl . __eou__,N
0,4288,You look like being on cloud nine .,N

11,4349,"Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ?",Y
12,4349,"You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details .",N
13,4349,Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ?,Y
14,4349,You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information .,Y
15,4349,"That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting . __eou__",Y
0,4350,"Oh , no !",N
1,4350,How dreadful !,N
2,4350,Look at the view from the window .,Y
3,4350,"Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected .",N
4,4350,"It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ?",N
5,4350,I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed .,N
6,4350,It can ’ t be helped . __eou__,N
0,4351,"Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ?",N
1,4351,"No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ?",N
2,4351,"Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room .",N
3,4351,She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious .,N
4,4351,"Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . __eou__",Y
0,4352,"Hi , Dave . This is Zina .",N
1,4352,Zina ? Zina the Snake ?,N
2,4352,I got your e-mail a couple of months back .,N
3,4352,Yeah ? Which one was that ?,N
4,4352,"The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep .",N
5,4352,Right . That one . Did it work ? __eou__,N
0,4353,"I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself .",N
1,4353,Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight .,Y
2,4353,I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ...,Y
3,4353,... and maybe that's what we both need .,Y
4,4353,I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow .,Y
5,4353,"OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . __eou__",N
0,4354,"Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !",N
1,4354,I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !,N
2,4354,But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !,N
3,4354,Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !,N
4,4354,What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?,N
5,4354,"Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !",N
6,4354,So he talks about you behind your back ?,N
7,4354,Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !,Y
8,4354,I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .,N
9,4354,I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .,Y
10,4354,"My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . __eou__",N
0,4355,"Oh , no . It looks like we're late .",N
1,4355,Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here .,Y
2,4355,There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ?,N
3,4355,They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen .,N
4,4355,That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well .,N
5,4355,"Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! __eou__",N
0,4356,Hurry up ! Time is money !,N
1,4356,Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time .,N
2,4356,But you are too slow to follow them .,N
3,4356,Don't you see I'm trying my best ? __eou__,N
0,4357,What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ?,N
1,4357,"I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .",N
2,4357,"Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .",N
3,4357,"I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .",Y
4,4357,You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__,N
0,4358,Wedding rings !,Y
1,4358,"Oh , no ...",N
2,4358,Aren't they cool ? I like the settings .,N
3,4358,"Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ?",N
4,4358,"No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ?",N
5,4358,Women are such dreamers .,N
6,4358,These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! __eou__,N
0,4359,"Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know .",N
1,4359,I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long .,N
2,4359,What happened ?,N
3,4359,My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one . __eou__,Y
0,4360,"Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ?",N
1,4360,Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up .,N
2,4360,"You are kidding , but she's so helpful .",N
3,4360,"Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you .",N
4,4360,Come on . She's like that with everyone .,N
5,4360,"I don't think so actually . She never even says "" hello "" to me . __eou__",N
0,4361,Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment .,N
1,4361,It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it .,N
2,4361,All you hear is the crickets and the breeze .,Y
3,4361,It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me .,Y
4,4361,"Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist .",Y
5,4361,That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . __eou__,N
0,4362,I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ?,N
1,4362,I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it .,N
2,4362,It's really very easy saying you're sorry .,N
3,4362,"Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . __eou__",Y
0,4363,Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad .,N
1,4363,I just lost my job . My boss just told me .,N
2,4363,That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ?,N
3,4363,I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money .,N
4,4363,I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . __eou__,N
0,4364,Harry was angry last night .,N
1,4364,"That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play .",N
2,4364,But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that .,N
3,4364,"Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . __eou__",Y
0,4365,He got the scholarship to Harvard .,N
1,4365,You're kidding !,N
2,4365,It's true . He is a hard worker .,N
3,4365,I know he really deserves this . __eou__,N
0,4366,I don't like this movie . It's a bomb .,N
1,4366,"Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it .",N
2,4366,"Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then .",N
3,4366,Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started . __eou__,N
0,4367,My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face .,N
1,4367,"Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon .",N
2,4367,How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one !,Y
3,4367,It spoiled my painting ! __eou__,N
0,4368,Thank you so much for coming tonight . Everybody really enjoyed your performance .,N
1,4368,I'm glad I could help .,N
2,4368,Here's the check . I included a little extra for you .,N
3,4368,You didn't have to do that !,N
4,4368,"I know , but you deserve it . __eou__",N
0,4369,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?",N
1,4369,No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .,N
2,4369,It better be more than last year .,N
3,4369,"Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__",Y
0,4370,What do you think about violence in movies ?,N
1,4370,"Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .",N
2,4370,"But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?",Y
3,4370,"If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . __eou__",N
0,4371,"I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .",N
1,4371,"I'm not sure I can't agree , dan .",N
2,4371,Why not ?,Y
3,4371,"Surely , there are other ways to save money .",Y
4,4371,"What are you talking about , we tried everything ! __eou__",N
0,4372,"I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .",N
1,4372,"Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .",Y
2,4372,How about the new bar across the road ?,Y
3,4372,Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .,N
4,4372,"I agree , I had lunch there last week .",N
5,4372,Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . __eou__,Y
0,4373,"Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore .",N
1,4373,But it was her that makes us so embarrassed .,N
2,4373,"I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ?",N
3,4373,I don't care . __eou__,N
0,4374,You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ?,N
1,4374,I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word .,N
2,4374,"I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ?",N
3,4374,"Yes , too good to be true . __eou__",N
0,4375,"When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it .",N
1,4375,"The last straw , huh ?",N
2,4375,"Yes , he's really pushed me too far .",N
3,4375,I know what you mean . __eou__,N
0,4376,I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug .,N
1,4376,There's no need to apologize .,N
2,4376,But I ruined your rug .,N
3,4376,Forget it . It was an accident . __eou__,N
0,4377,You didn't tell me she was married !,N
1,4377,I tried . You were preoccupied .,N
2,4377,I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me !,N
3,4377,"You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up .",Y
4,4377,That guy was definitely a Don .,N
5,4377,So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha .,N
6,4377,Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ...,Y
7,4377,Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . __eou__,Y
0,4378,Is there something wrong ? You look so sad .,N
1,4378,My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .,N
2,4378,No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ?,N
3,4378,"Yes , I have . But I have to wait . __eou__",N
0,4379,"Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look !",N
1,4379,"What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line .",N
2,4379,No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me !,N
3,4379,You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . __eou__,Y
0,4380,Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ?,N
1,4380,Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk .,N
2,4380,"The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought .",N
3,4380,"Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago .",N
4,4380,That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith .,N
5,4380,"Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry .",N
6,4380,I'm really sick ! __eou__,N
0,4381,"It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you .",Y
1,4381,Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ...,N
2,4381,"This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ...",N
3,4381,I'll tell you all about it another day .,N
4,4381,"But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ?",N
5,4381,You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... __eou__,Y
0,4382,"You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ?",N
1,4382,Why am I always the last to know these things ?,N
2,4382,I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ?,N
3,4382,"No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing .",N
4,4382,How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes .,N
5,4382,"He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! __eou__",N
0,4383,"You know , Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days .",N
1,4383,And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves .,N
2,4383,But you're not to blame for them keeping him there .,N
3,4383,"Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ?",N
4,4383,"I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy .",Y
5,4383,"Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry . __eou__",Y
0,4384,Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message .,N
1,4384,Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead !,Y
2,4384,That's OK . Just let it out . I'm OK ! I was out of town with ... Femi .,N
3,4384,"Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ?",N
4,4384,Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow . __eou__,Y
0,4385,I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary .,N
1,4385,It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare .,N
2,4385,But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work .,Y
3,4385,Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him .,Y
4,4385,This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five .,N
5,4385,It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . __eou__,Y
0,4386,Did everyone fill out their entry permits ?,N
1,4386,Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants .,N
2,4386,"Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ...",Y
3,4386,It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne !,N
4,4386,That's because it's time .,N
5,4386,Time for what ?,N
6,4386,It's time to make our wedding wish come true ...,Y
7,4386,You mean get married now ? On the plane ?,N
8,4386,Why not ? I've got the rings ready .,Y
9,4386,"I don't know what to say , Jack !",N

2,4388,"It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ...",N
3,4388,They're going to give us back the seats ?,N
4,4388,"No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ...",N
5,4388,Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ?,N
6,4388,You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas .,Y
7,4388,"Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! __eou__",N
0,4389,Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .,N
1,4389,You have much patience .,N
2,4389,Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !,N
3,4389,Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .,Y
4,4389,What does it say ?,N
5,4389,"This is an especially famous one . It says "" May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . """,Y
6,4389,That's very nice . Is it for sale ?,N
7,4389,No . I never sell my artwork .,N
8,4389,Really ? Then what do you do with it ?,N
9,4389,"I give it away . Here , this one is for you .",Y
10,4389,Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !,N

2,4390,"Actually , it's better ...",Y
3,4390,What ? Are you kidding ?,N
4,4390,No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...,Y

1,4391,Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger .,N
2,4391,I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over !,N
3,4391,That takes talent ...,N
4,4391,I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing !,N
5,4391,He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . __eou__,N
0,4392,Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ?,N
1,4392,"No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at !",N
2,4392,"Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he !",Y
3,4392,My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ...,N

0,4393,What ? I don't get it ...,N

2,4394,"Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing !",N
3,4394,I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ?,Y
4,4394,I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! __eou__,Y
0,4395,Did you go to the movie yesterday ?,N

1,4399,I think a mountain village is splendid !,Y
2,4399,I don't agree with you . It's too small to live .,N
3,4399,"It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town .",Y
4,4399,"I disagree , a big town is more lively .",N
5,4399,But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill !,Y

4,4418,Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ?,N
5,4418,No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean .,N

3,4423,No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !,N
4,4423,"Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before .",Y
5,4423,"I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?",N

0,4448,Who did the stupid thing ?,N
1,4448,Maybe it was Dick .,Y
2,4448,I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .,N
3,4448,Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__,N
0,4449,How did Jim get the money ?,N
1,4449,He borrowed it from Nick .,N

3,4450,Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .,Y
4,4450,You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?,Y
5,4450,But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .,N
6,4450,"Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .",Y
7,4450,Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .,Y
8,4450,I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .,N
9,4450,Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .,Y
10,4450,That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .,N
11,4450,How about a training course ?,Y
12,4450,A training course ? That must be costly .,N
13,4450,But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .,Y
14,4450,"OK , let's have a try .",Y

6,4457,The dog bit the delivery boy .,N
7,4457,What a pity !,N
8,4457,And a storm blew our roof away .,N

3,4459,Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual .,N

5,4459,You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet .,N

0,4464,Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ?,N
1,4464,You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers .,Y
2,4464,Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself .,N
3,4464,You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself .,N
4,4464,Did you hear the names he was calling me ?,N
5,4464,I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? __eou__,N
0,4465,There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know .,N

2,4466,"Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .",N
3,4466,"I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .",Y
4,4466,You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__,N
0,4467,I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ?,N
1,4467,I think you'd better apologize .,N

3,4467,"Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . __eou__",N
0,4468,All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull .,N
1,4468,"Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls .",Y
2,4468,Then why are you wearing black shoes ?,N
3,4468,"Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go .",N
4,4468,"Hey , thanks , mum . __eou__",N
0,4469,Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make .,Y

4,4494,For example ?,N
5,4494,"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .",N
6,4494,"No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .",N
7,4494,It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .,N
8,4494,"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .",Y
9,4494,You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?,N
10,4494,"We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .",N
11,4494,That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . __eou__,Y
0,4495,"Come in , come in !",N
1,4495,"Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?",N
2,4495,I thought we were supposed to meet HERE .,N
3,4495,Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .,N
4,4495,I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .,N
5,4495,Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?,Y
6,4495,You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie .,N
7,4495,It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . __eou__,N
0,4496,Do you have to leave soon ?,N
1,4496,No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty .,N
2,4496,"Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush .",N
3,4496,Yeah . You know what Dave just said ?,N
4,4496,What ?,N
5,4496,"He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target .",N
6,4496,He knows you very well .,N
7,4496,"He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance .",N
8,4496,"I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular .",N
9,4496,"No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . __eou__",N
0,4497,"Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking .",Y
1,4497,I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ?,N
2,4497,"I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .",N
3,4497,"I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight .",N
4,4497,"It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .",Y
5,4497,"You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . __eou__",N
0,4498,"I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office .",N
1,4498,"Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ?",Y
2,4498,What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one .,Y
3,4498,"Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__",Y
0,4499,How beautiful the flower is !,Y
1,4499,"Really , it's so beautiful .",N
2,4499,"You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .",N

5,4499,It's a private garden . __eou__,N
0,4500,They promised us a sea view .,N
1,4500,"Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys .",Y
2,4500,Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks .,N
3,4500,"Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__",N
0,4501,"So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ?",N
1,4501,"Stolen ? No , why ?",N
2,4501,My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .,Y
3,4501,Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless .,N
4,4501,I don't know . The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good .,N
5,4501,"If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened .",N
6,4501,He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . And on a crowded street too .,N
7,4501,Didn't anyone stop them ?,N
8,4501,You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .,Y
9,4501,"Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all .",N
10,4501,That's not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . __eou__,Y
0,4502,"Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?",N
1,4502,I don ’ t want to .,N
2,4502,"Well , come and talk to me then .",Y
3,4502,Certainly not .,N
4,4502,May I turn on the radio then ?,N
5,4502,Turn on the radio ? What for ?,N
6,4502,So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .,Y
7,4502,Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ?,N
8,4502,"Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .",Y
9,4502,"To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . __eou__",N
0,4503,"Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ?",N
1,4503,Promise you are not going to be angry ?,N
2,4503,"Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ?",N

4,4505,It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really !,Y
5,4505,"Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . __eou__",N
0,4506,It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills .,N
1,4506,Really ? There aren't many left now .,N
2,4506,"No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .",N
3,4506,Were there any animals in the forest ?,N
4,4506,"Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . __eou__",Y
0,4507,Would you like a cup of coffee ?,N
1,4507,Yes.That would be good .,Y
2,4507,"Oh , no .",N
3,4507,What's the matter ?,N

1,4509,"120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ?",N
2,4509,I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid .,N
3,4509,Just don't come looking to me for help .,N
4,4509,Don't worry . I won't .,N
5,4509,I'm signing off .,N

3,4510,It's my dream . __eou__,Y
0,4511,Who did the stupid thing ?,N

0,4513,just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively .,Y
1,4513,It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive .,Y
2,4513,"This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco .",N
3,4513,What's the difference ?,N
4,4513,We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing !,Y
5,4513,What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ?,Y
6,4513,I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air .,Y
7,4513,But they are not as convenient as the subway .,N
8,4513,You miss the point ! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere .,N
9,4513,"Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway .",Y

2,4597,"Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ?",Y
3,4597,"Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out .",N
4,4597,Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy .,Y
5,4597,You hit the nail right on the head .,N
6,4597,"Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ?",N
7,4597,What is it ?,N
8,4597,"It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English .",Y
9,4597,Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ?,Y
10,4597,How about this sunday ?,N
11,4597,"Ok , cool .",N

1,4598,"Sorry , I thought you knew .",N
2,4598,But you should tell me you were in love with her .,N
3,4598,Didn't I ?,N
4,4598,You know you didn't .,N
5,4598,"Well , I am telling you now .",N
6,4598,"Yes , but you might have told me before .",N
7,4598,I didn't think you would be interested .,N
8,4598,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?,N
9,4598,"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .",N
10,4598,"Oh , you men ! You are all the same . __eou__",N
0,4599,"David , why don't you clean your room ?",N
1,4599,I am not in the mood .,N
2,4599,Why are you feeling depress ?,N
3,4599,I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown .,N
4,4599,I don't think she would do such a thing .,N
5,4599,But she did and it made me disappointed .,N
6,4599,"Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything .",N
7,4599,But she means a lot to me .,N
8,4599,Then forgive her mistake .,N
9,4599,"Oh , I just can't forget it . __eou__",N
0,4600,The concert was really great .,N

3,4603,"I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack .",N
4,4603,You are welcome . __eou__,N
0,4604,"I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .",N
1,4604,You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .,Y
2,4604,"You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . __eou__",N
0,4605,"Philip , I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations !",N
1,4605,"Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there .",N
2,4605,Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !,N
3,4605,"Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! __eou__",N
0,4606,Have you followed the value of dollar lately ?,N
1,4606,"How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it .",Y
2,4606,"It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke .",N
3,4606,"Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate .",N
4,4606,"What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in .",Y
5,4606,What about the Yen ?,Y
6,4606,Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__,N
0,4607,"This is today ’ s schedule . At eight thirty , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives .",N
1,4607,That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?,N
2,4607,3000 RIB as bonus for each person .,Y
3,4607,To encourage the staff increases .,Y
4,4607,"Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch .",N
5,4607,What about the afternoon ?,Y
6,4607,"At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . __eou__",N
0,4608,"Hi , Lander . What's wrong ?",N
1,4608,I can hardly make ends meet these days .,N
2,4608,Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .,N
3,4608,My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .,N
4,4608,True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .,N
5,4608,Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . __eou__,N
0,4609,Do you have s second ?,N
1,4609,Sure . What do you want ?,N
2,4609,I want to tell you I've put in my notice .,N
3,4609,Really ? Why ?,N
4,4609,"I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays .",Y
5,4609,And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ?,N
6,4609,"Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair .",Y
7,4609,"Absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade .",N
8,4609,That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__,Y
0,4610,The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?,N
1,4610,It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun .,N
2,4610,"Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ?",Y
3,4610,Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ...,N
4,4610,Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself .,N
5,4610,You're dancing so well .,N
6,4610,You dance beautifully too .,N
7,4610,When did you learn to dance ?,N
8,4610,In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?,N
9,4610,It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__,N
0,4611,"Excuse me . In this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures .",N
1,4611,Is that right ? I didn't know it .,N
2,4611,Will you give me your camera ? We have to confiscate your film .,N
3,4611,Will you forgive me . Could you return my camera ?,N
4,4611,We will keep and return it later .,N
5,4611,"Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ?",N
6,4611,You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit . __eou__,N
0,4612,I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices .,N
1,4612,"These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit .",Y
2,4612,"Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ?",N
3,4612,"We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition .",Y
4,4612,"You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . __eou__",N
0,4613,"Yes , sir ?",N
1,4613,"I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty .",N
2,4613,I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . __eou__,N
0,4614,"Hello , is this the ABC company ?",N
1,4614,"Yes , may I help you ?",N
2,4614,"We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it .",N
3,4614,What is your reservation number ?,N
4,4614,Our reservation number is J - 221 .,N
5,4614,"Let me see . Oh , yes , we have your reservation number .",N
6,4614,You mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ?,N
7,4614,I ’ m sorry to say no .,N
8,4614,"Here I ’ ll take taxi instead , how do you refund us ? __eou__",N
0,4615,"are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you !",N
1,4615,"I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week .",N
2,4615,"Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ...",N
3,4615,"No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .",N
4,4615,"What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .",Y
5,4615,"They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .",N
6,4615,That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?,N
7,4615,"I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .",N
8,4615,it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__,Y
0,4616,Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour !,N
1,4616,"Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full .",N
2,4616,Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare !,N
3,4616,"Madam , patience is a virtue .",N
4,4616,"Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore !",N
5,4616,I'm sure a spot will open up soon .,N
6,4616,"Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? __eou__",N
0,4617,"Oh , my god !",N
1,4617,What !,N
2,4617,That's the cutest little doll I've ever seen in my life !,N
3,4617,Chill out . It's just Kenny from South Park .,N
4,4617,What park ? You found a doll in a park ? Gross !,N
5,4617,"South Park is a popular cartoon . You're so out of it , Jen",N
6,4617,"Well , don't blame me ! I never get a chance to watch TV . __eou__",N
0,4618,What's that ?,N
1,4618,It's a surprise !,Y
2,4618,For me ?,N
3,4618,Yes . Let's go inside and you can open it up .,Y
4,4618,Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ?,Y
5,4618,"I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat .",N
6,4618,"What does that mean , not big but fat ? You didn't buy ... __eou__",N
0,4619,"And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries !",Y
1,4619,Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome !,N
2,4619,And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage .,Y
3,4619,You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high .,N
4,4619,I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music .,Y
5,4619,You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! __eou__,Y
0,4620,Mary ? Are you still there ?,N
1,4620,Yes . What do you want ?,N
2,4620,Did your bid win ?,N
3,4620,"What do you care , dork ?",N
4,4620,"Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ?",N
5,4620,You mean fat boy ?,N
6,4620,Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . __eou__,N
0,4621,Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue .,Y
1,4621,I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ?,N
2,4621,And let them ruin my life ? Forget it !,N
3,4621,But you've been looking for that stamp for years .,N
4,4621,"It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills .",N
5,4621,Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck .,N
6,4621,"Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . __eou__",N
0,4622,How do you get along with your co-workers ?,N
1,4622,"I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip .",N
2,4622,Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ?,N
3,4622,"It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts .",N
4,4622,So how do you develop good relationships in the office ?,Y
5,4622,"I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with .",Y
6,4622,"I think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others . __eou__",Y
0,4623,I always think everybody looks down on me,N
1,4623,Don't be that negative .,N
2,4623,How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes .,Y
3,4623,I find it there is no meaning in living this world .,N
4,4623,Don't be that negative .,N
5,4623,"Really , life is so boring . __eou__",N
0,4624,I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me .,N
1,4624,It can't be that bad .,N
2,4624,"But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work .",N
3,4624,"At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day .",N
4,4624,"That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ?",Y
5,4624,"I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office .",Y
6,4624,"I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit .",Y
7,4624,"Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . __eou__",Y
0,4625,Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ?,N
1,4625,"Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all .",N
2,4625,So you didn ’ t . Is that right ?,N
3,4625,Yes . I ’ m sorry .,N
4,4625,Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .,N
5,4625,"Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this .",N
6,4625,"You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer .",Y
7,4625,"But you know if he brought it or not , right ?",N
8,4625,"Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . __eou__",N
0,4626,"I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office .",N
1,4626,"Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ?",Y
2,4626,What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one .,Y
3,4626,"Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__",Y
0,4627,Would you go to the bookstore with me ?,N
1,4627,It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go .,Y
2,4627,Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ?,N
3,4627,"Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels .",N
4,4627,So what are you interested in ?,N
5,4627,"Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian .",Y
6,4627,I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular .,N
7,4627,Yes . I can lend you some .,N
8,4627,Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . __eou__,N
0,4628,I prefer potatoes to eggplants .,N
1,4628,I feel eggplants are more nutritious .,N
2,4628,"But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .",N
3,4628,"Oh , that's how you see it . __eou__",N
0,4629,"Hi , Becky , what's up ?",N
1,4629,"Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .",N
2,4629,What's the problem ?,N
3,4629,She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .,N
4,4629,For example ?,N
5,4629,"Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .",N
6,4629,"No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .",N
7,4629,It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .,N
8,4629,"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__",N
0,4630,"Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair .",N
1,4630,"Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living .",N
2,4630,That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified .,Y
3,4630,I guess I never thought of that before .,Y
4,4630,"And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .",Y
5,4630,"Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! __eou__",Y
0,4631,I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off .,N
1,4631,I apologize . This should not have to be this way .,N
2,4631,Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time .,N
3,4631,"Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . __eou__",N
0,4632,"She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth !",N
1,4632,"Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within .",Y
2,4632,"Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air .",N
3,4632,She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ?,Y
4,4632,"Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things .",N
5,4632,"They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ?",Y
6,4632,"Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it .",Y
7,4632,"That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? __eou__",N
0,4633,What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .,N
1,4633,What do you mean ?,N
2,4633,"Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . __eou__",N
0,4634,"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .",Y
1,4634,"Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .",Y
2,4634,"Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .",Y
3,4634,"I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__",Y
0,4635,"You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator .",N
1,4635,"Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works .",Y
2,4635,I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice .,N
3,4635,"Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution .",Y
4,4635,Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down .,Y
5,4635,"Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__",Y

5,4644,"You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea .",N
6,4644,"No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes .",Y
7,4644,I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time .,N
8,4644,"I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight .",Y
9,4644,"Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that .",N
10,4644,"Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .",Y
11,4644,I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__,N
0,4645,Let me clear away the broken glass .,N

0,4655,I feel pity for the old man .,N
1,4655,I feel the same way .,N

1,4660,"Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it .",N
2,4660,"Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it .",N
3,4660,But I don't think much of it . __eou__,N
0,4661,Every teacher likes him .,N
1,4661,They say he can sum up like winking .,N
2,4661,How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me .,N
3,4661,Maybe he's gifted in that . __eou__,Y
0,4662,"Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe .",N

3,4663,"But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers .",N
4,4663,What if he had his friends fake the reviews ?,Y
5,4663,"You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . __eou__",N
0,4664,"The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural !",Y

5,4676,"sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too .",Y
6,4676,that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?,N
7,4676,that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there .,Y
8,4676,"fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .",N

4,4677,it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?,Y
5,4677,"you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .",N
6,4677,what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?,Y

3,4680,What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new !,N
4,4680,"Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .",N
5,4680,Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ?,N
6,4680,"I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .",N
7,4680,What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! __eou__,N
0,4681,"Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ?",N

0,4688,Let ’ s cross here .,Y
1,4688,You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light .,N

0,4693,I'm really sick of waiting for a bus .,N
1,4693,Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do .,N

0,4694,I'm tired of dancing .,N
1,4694,But to me it's really enjoyable .,Y
2,4694,Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners .,N
3,4694,Maybe so . __eou__,Y
0,4695,I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore .,N
1,4695,Young people enjoy pop songs more .,Y

4,4699,"I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty .",N
5,4699,"Ok , then please bring me the steak mediun-rare , thank you .",N
6,4699,"Ok , Miss . I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner . __eou__",N
0,4700,Bother the flies !,N
1,4700,Where do they come from ?,N
2,4700,I don't know . Something rotten here ?,N
3,4700,I can't see it . __eou__,N
0,4701,"Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level .",Y
1,4701,So what are you trying to say to me ?,N
2,4701,It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating .,N
3,4701,How should I say it ?,N
4,4701,I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further .,Y
5,4701,"It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over .",Y
6,4701,Like what ?,N
7,4701,Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek .,N
8,4701,It was only the cheek .,N
9,4701,"That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car .",N
10,4701,"Oh , that is ridiculous .",N
11,4701,So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ?,N
12,4701,Definitely not .,N
13,4701,"You see , we still have hurdle . __eou__",N
0,4702,What do you think of being a secretary ?,Y
1,4702,I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy .,N
2,4702,How come ?,N
3,4702,You have to type all day . __eou__,N
0,4703,That guy's manner really turns me off .,N
1,4703,Yeah.He never stops asking questions .,N
2,4703,Maybe he's abnormal . __eou__,Y
0,4704,All the routine work really browns me off .,N
1,4704,"Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started .",N
2,4704,I wish I hadn't chosen this job . __eou__,N
0,4705,That woman is a thorough drag !,N
1,4705,What is it ?,N
2,4705,She keeps spitting on the ground .,N
3,4705,Maybe there's something wrong with her . __eou__,Y
0,4706,"i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on Friday , but i really can't decide what to do .",N
1,4706,what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ?,Y
2,4706,"not bad , any other ideas ?",Y
3,4706,"well , there is a play on campus this weekend .",Y
4,4706,good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ?,Y
5,4706,what's the matter with these ideas ?,N
6,4706,"They are good , but i still need a few more .",N
7,4706,what about going on a picnic ?,Y
8,4706,"Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ?",N
9,4706,"you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ?",Y
10,4706,they are all good . __eou__,N
0,4707,Do you like our new history teacher ?,N
1,4707,I'm fed up with his endless talking .,N
2,4707,You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person .,N
3,4707,I can't see it . __eou__,N
0,4708,My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look !,N
1,4708,So cool ! Can I get a load of it ? __eou__,N
0,4709,I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool .,N
1,4709,You flatter me . __eou__,N
0,4710,I am really impressed with your presentation skills .,N
1,4710,Thank you . I have been working on it for several years .,N
2,4710,"Well , your time has been well spent !",N
3,4710,"It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff !",Y
4,4710,"Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! __eou__",N
0,4711,Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?,N
1,4711,I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .,Y
2,4711,Then tell me what's good about it .,N
3,4711,It can't be expressed by words . __eou__,N
0,4712,"I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox .",N
1,4712,"Yeah , I think it will be wonderful . __eou__",Y
0,4713,I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ?,N
1,4713,"Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do",Y
2,4713,"That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500",N
3,4713,But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 .,N
4,4713,The advertised rate is based on double occupancy .,N
5,4713,"When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that .",N
6,4713,Are you quite sure ?,N
7,4713,Yes . Have a look .,N
8,4713,"I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page .",N
9,4713,Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate .,Y
10,4713,"Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim .",Y
11,4713,Thank you . __eou__,N
0,4714,Your search on this project has been excellent .,N
1,4714,Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team .,N
2,4714,The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .,N
3,4714,"Well , I hope the client feels the same way !",N
4,4714,I am sure they will be pleased . __eou__,N
0,4715,We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?,N
1,4715,It ’ s so cool ! __eou__,N
0,4716,You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut .,N
1,4716,Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends . __eou__,N
0,4717,Could you do me a favour ? I don ’ t understand this French document .,Y
1,4717,"Oh , this is over my head . It ’ s too professional . __eou__",N
0,4718,I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out .,N
1,4718,70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that . __eou__,N
0,4719,"So , Emily , how was your day ?",N
1,4719,I don't think you really want to hear about it .,N
2,4719,It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .,Y
3,4719,"To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !",N
4,4719,Why ? What happened ?,N
5,4719,"Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !",N
6,4719,That's not very fair . What did you do ?,N
7,4719,"There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure .",N
8,4719,Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?,N
9,4719,"He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !",N
10,4719,Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?,N
11,4719,I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !,Y
12,4719,Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?,N
13,4719,Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .,N
14,4719,That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders .,N
15,4719,"I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .",N
16,4719,"That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . __eou__",Y
0,4720,I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !,N
1,4720,Why ? What are they like ?,N
2,4720,They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !,N
3,4720,Have you ever talked to them about it ?,N
4,4720,"I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !",N
5,4720,What did they say ?,N
6,4720,They both just talk about how great they are all the time .,N
7,4720,They soud like the neighbours from hell !,N
8,4720,"They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .",N
9,4720,I thought you didn't talk to them much .,N
10,4720,"I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .",N
11,4720,What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?,N
12,4720,Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .,N
13,4720,Maybe you should think about moving .,Y
14,4720,I can't afford to move right now .,N
15,4720,"Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive .",Y
16,4720,"I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .",N
17,4720,"Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? __eou__",N
0,4721,Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much .,N
1,4721,Let ’ s go for a joy ride . __eou__,Y
0,4722,"Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are .",N
1,4722,"To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day .",N
2,4722,What happened ?,N
3,4722,"First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work .",N
4,4722,What did your boss say ?,N
5,4722,"He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean !",N
6,4722,That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?,N
7,4722,"That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident .",N
8,4722,Is your boss Chinese ?,N
9,4722,"No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things .",N
10,4722,What are you going to do ?,N
11,4722,I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss .,Y
12,4722,That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ?,Y
13,4722,That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer .,N
14,4722,Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! __eou__,N
0,4723,"Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you !",N
1,4723,Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up ! __eou__,N
0,4724,I got a promotion . Lunch is on me .,N
1,4724,It ’ s great . __eou__,N
0,4725,This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up .,N
1,4725,En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . __eou__,N
0,4726,I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ?,Y
1,4726,Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment . __eou__,N
0,4727,Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious .,N
1,4727,"Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him . __eou__",N
0,4728,I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad .,N
1,4728,He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . __eou__,N
0,4729,I find that every employee here respects that manager very much .,N
1,4729,Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . __eou__,N
0,4730,Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard .,N
1,4730,I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . __eou__,Y
0,4731,"Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?",N
1,4731,I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .,N
2,4731,How come ?,N
3,4731,"It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't .",N
4,4731,I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?,Y
5,4731,Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . __eou__,N
0,4732,Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome .,N
1,4732,"Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball .",N
2,4732,"Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect . __eou__",N
0,4733,"Jane , what do think about this dinner ?",N
1,4733,Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time . __eou__,N
0,4734,How do you like the pizza here ?,N
1,4734,Perfect . It really hits the spot . __eou__,N
0,4735,Hurry up . Time is running out .,N
1,4735,I see . I have run as fast as I can . __eou__,N
0,4736,"Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers .",N
1,4736,"Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you . __eou__",N
0,4737,"Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering .",N
1,4737,"OK , boy . I will buy it for you . __eou__",N
0,4738,I ran into a glass door yesterday .,N
1,4738,What a bone head ! Be careful next time . __eou__,N
0,4739,It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go .,N
1,4739,Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . __eou__,N
0,4740,what a nice uniform !,N
1,4740,thanks ; do you like it ?,N
2,4740,not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ?,N
3,4740,"yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional .",N
4,4740,they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ?,Y
5,4740,"I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day .",N
6,4740,so are you enjoying your new job ?,N
7,4740,it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great .,N
8,4740,how do you like working in sales ?,N
9,4740,I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster .,N
10,4740,that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department .,N
11,4740,"yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman !",N
12,4740,I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos !,Y
13,4740,how do you know her ?,N
14,4740,she's my cousin .,N
15,4740,why didn't you tell me about that before ?,N
16,4740,I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting .,N
17,4740,"well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime .",Y
18,4740,that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . __eou__,Y
0,4741,Wow ! It ’ s packed .,N
1,4741,The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . __eou__,Y
0,4742,"Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone .",N
1,4742,Don ’ t worry about it .,N
2,4742,I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it .,N
3,4742,I think you just need to get more sleep .,N
4,4742,"Yes , you ’ re right . Good night . __eou__",N
0,4743,you're rather energetic today . What's going on ?,Y
1,4743,nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees .,N
2,4743,"free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ?",N
3,4743,it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ?,N
4,4743,not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today .,N
5,4743,why is that ?,N
6,4743,my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend !,N
7,4743,"your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ?",N
8,4743,you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work !,N
9,4743,that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office .,N
10,4743,really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy .,N
11,4743,maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all !,Y
12,4743,"no , he is . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T .",N
13,4743,try not to let it bother you too much .,N
14,4743,thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again !,N
15,4743,"ok , I'll see you in a bit .",N
16,4743,alright . See you later ! __eou__,N
0,4744,is everything alright ?,N
1,4744,"yes , everything is fine .",N
2,4744,what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !,N
3,4744,didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?,N
4,4744,I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ?,N
5,4744,"we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem .",N
6,4744,then what ? Your plane was three hours late !,N
7,4744,"we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight .",N
8,4744,"turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ?",Y
9,4744,"yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early .",N
10,4744,so where did you land ?,N
11,4744,we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again .,N
12,4744,that sounds like a nightmare !,N
13,4744,it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive .,N
14,4744,have you had anything to eat ?,N
15,4744,I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ?,N
16,4744,I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! __eou__,N
0,4745,"wow , it that your sports car ?",N
1,4745,"yes , do you like it ?",N
2,4745,I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?,N
3,4745,"it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .",Y
4,4745,what's wrong with it ?,N
5,4745,"well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .",Y
6,4745,when's the last time you had it serviced ?,N
7,4745,it must have been a few years ago now .,N
8,4745,I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .,N
9,4745,"they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !",Y
10,4745,what else is wrong with it ?,N
11,4745,"the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !",N
12,4745,anything else ?,N
13,4745,the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .,Y
14,4745,why don't you get it all fixed ?,Y
15,4745,"it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !",Y
16,4745,"well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__",N
0,4746,"so , how should we go to the theatre ?",N
1,4746,let's take the bus .,Y
2,4746,"I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .",N
3,4746,it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .,N
4,4746,"it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .",Y
5,4746,"we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .",Y
6,4746,"train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .",N
7,4746,"if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?",N
8,4746,"we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .",N
9,4746,I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .,N
10,4746,fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .,N
11,4746,it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes .,N
12,4746,don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .,N
13,4746,"thanks , that was nice of you .",N
14,4746,"see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! __eou__",Y
0,4747,"I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet .",N
1,4747,I am just casting pearls before swine . __eou__,N
0,4748,You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable .,Y
1,4748,I was not born yesterday . __eou__,N
0,4749,did you get my email ?,N
1,4749,I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ?,N
2,4749,sure .,N
3,4749,how did the business trip go ?,N
4,4749,"well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .",Y
5,4749,"I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !",N
6,4749,I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !,Y
7,4749,our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .,Y
8,4749,"I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me .",N
9,4749,I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .,Y
10,4749,thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !,N
11,4749,no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?,N
12,4749,"no , should I have ? __eou__",N
0,4750,are you ready to go the concert ?,N
1,4750,yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ?,N
2,4750,"actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour .",Y
3,4750,"that's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then .",Y
4,4750,is your helmet comfortable ?,N
5,4750,"not really , but I liked the design , so I got it .",N
6,4750,maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .,Y
7,4750,I'll think about it .,N
8,4750,is that your new bicycle ?,N
9,4750,"yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ?",N
10,4750,it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive !,Y
11,4750,nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .,N
12,4750,I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ?,N
13,4750,"well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?",Y
14,4750,that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .,Y
15,4750,is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?,N
16,4750,it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__,Y
0,4751,Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man .,N

1,4753,I got the short end of the stick . __eou__,N
0,4754,I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me .,N
1,4754,She can cope with it . Don ’ t be such a wimp ! __eou__,N
0,4755,You are freaking me out .,N
1,4755,You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! __eou__,N
0,4756,It smells like an ashtray in here !,N
1,4756,Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ?,N
2,4756,What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .,N
3,4756,No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight !,N
4,4756,"Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before .",Y
5,4756,"I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ?",N
6,4756,Fine ! I want a divorce ! __eou__,N
0,4757,Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth !,N

0,4758,Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye,N
1,4758,"Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down .",N
2,4758,I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times .,N
3,4758,Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know .,Y
4,4758,"Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off .",N
5,4758,"Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness .",Y
6,4758,I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ...,Y
7,4758,"Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one !",Y
8,4758,You are something else you know that ? __eou__,N
0,4759,"Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .",N

2,4759,"I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?",N
3,4759,"Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .",N
4,4759,But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .,N
5,4759,I know why we have reservations .,N
6,4759,"I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .",Y
7,4759,But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like .,N
8,4759,Fine . I ’ ll take the compact .,N
9,4759,"Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?",N
10,4759,"Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . __eou__",N
0,4760,Look at what you have done . All thumbs .,N
1,4760,"I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . __eou__",N
0,4761,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !",N
1,4761,What ? What did you buy ?,N
2,4761,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !,N
3,4761,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?,N
4,4761,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .",N
5,4761,And ?,N
6,4761,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .,N
7,4761,And it's a brick ?,N
8,4761,Yes .,N
9,4761,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,N
10,4761,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .",N
11,4761,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .,N
12,4761,"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .",N
13,4761,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,Y
14,4761,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .,N
15,4761,"Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",N
16,4761,"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .",Y
17,4761,That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,Y
18,4761,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__",N
0,4762,"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?",N
1,4762,Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ?,N
2,4762,"What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news !",N
3,4762,"Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess .",Y
4,4762,For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ?,N
5,4762,"Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months .",N
6,4762,What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ?,N
7,4762,"Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost .",N
8,4762,Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !,Y
9,4762,"We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country .",N
10,4762,We ’ re doomed !,N
11,4762,There is some really good news though !,Y
12,4762,Really ? What !,N

4,4763,"Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .",N
5,4763,He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !,N
6,4763,"Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .",N
7,4763,Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .,N

4,4764,I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .,N
5,4764,"yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .",N
6,4764,that's true .,N
7,4764,"anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?",N
8,4764,it was good . I brough lunch from home today .,N
9,4764,you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .,N
10,4764,"well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy .",N
11,4764,"i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .",Y
12,4764,"yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ?",N
13,4764,you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .,N
14,4764,"well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .",Y

10,4765,It is December 25th .,N
11,4765,Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day .,N
12,4765,"Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ?",N
13,4765,"April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too !",N
14,4765,"That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast .",N

3,4766,"yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ?",Y
4,4766,"it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .",Y
5,4766,how about this blue sweater ?,Y
6,4766,that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?,N
7,4766,"yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ?",Y
8,4766,that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings .,N
9,4766,I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is .,N

2,4767,same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .,N
3,4767,my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .,N
4,4767,true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .,N
5,4767,definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .,N
6,4767,"the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .",N
7,4767,is that inflation ?,N
8,4767,"inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .",Y
9,4767,has the government taken some measures to curb it ?,N
10,4767,yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .,N
11,4767,but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .,N
12,4767,you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .,N
13,4767,how ?,N
14,4767,"for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .",Y
15,4767,sounds a good idea . __eou__,Y
0,4768,Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .,Y

I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau .",Y

3,4770,"Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",day

4,4777,Okay ...,N
5,4777,I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go .,N
6,4777,What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ?,N
7,4777,"I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee !",N
8,4777,What ! I resent that !,N
9,4777,"Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! __eou__",N
0,4778,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !",N
1,4778,What ? What did you buy ?,N
2,4778,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !,N
3,4778,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?,N
4,4778,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .",N
5,4778,And ?,N
6,4778,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .,N
7,4778,And it's a brick ?,N
8,4778,Yes .,N
9,4778,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,N
10,4778,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .",N
11,4778,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .,N
12,4778,"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .",N
13,4778,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,Y
14,4778,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .,N
15,4778,"Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",N
16,4778,"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .",Y
17,4778,That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,Y
18,4778,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__",N
0,4779,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !",N
1,4779,What is it ? What happened ?,N
2,4779,I think someone is stalking me .,N
3,4779,"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?",N
4,4779,"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",N
5,4779,What did you do ?,N
6,4779,"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .",N
7,4779,Did he leave when you left ?,N
8,4779,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .,N
9,4779,What did you do ?,N
10,4779,He followed me all the way home !,N
11,4779,That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .,N
12,4779,"Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?",N
13,4779,"Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .",Y
14,4779,Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !,Y
15,4779,Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .,Y
16,4779,I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .,N
17,4779,"Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .",N
18,4779,Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__,N
0,4780,I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !,Y
1,4780,So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?,N
2,4780,"That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !",Y
3,4780,Have you ever written up a business plan before ?,N
4,4780,"Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?",N
5,4780,"You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .",Y
6,4780,"Well , that seems easy enough .",N
7,4780,"Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .",Y
8,4780,Geez . Is that all ?,N
9,4780,"Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !",Y
10,4780,Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__,N
0,4781,Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat !,Y
1,4781,"Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy .",N
2,4781,"Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks !",N
3,4781,Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top .,N
4,4781,"Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you !",N
5,4781,Um ... no .,N
6,4781,"Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! __eou__",Y
0,4782,What do you think of this one ?,N
1,4782,"Eh , so so .",N
2,4782,And this one ? Too flashy ?,N
3,4782,"Nah , not too flashy .",N
4,4782,Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?,N
5,4782,I guess .,N
6,4782,Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .,N
7,4782,"And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !",N
8,4782,Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !,Y
9,4782,Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !,N
10,4782,"Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !",N
11,4782,"Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?",N
12,4782,I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !,N
13,4782,And Merry Christmas !,N
14,4782,Merry Christmas ! __eou__,N
0,4783,"Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ?",N
1,4783,Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything .,N
2,4783,The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy .,N
3,4783,Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !,N
4,4783,"I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?",N
5,4783,You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ?,N
6,4783,"Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .",Y
7,4783,Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down .,N
8,4783,"Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same.So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? __eou__",N
0,4784,The mosquitos are biting me !,N
1,4784,"Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks .",N
2,4784,Do you have any bug spray ?,N
3,4784,"No , I forgot to buy some .",N
4,4784,Then we ’ ll have to put up with it .,N
5,4784,"We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep .",Y
6,4784,"That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it !",Y
7,4784,Run ! They are thirsty for more ! __eou__,Y
0,4785,What are you doing ?,N
1,4785,Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty .,N
2,4785,Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful !,N
3,4785,"Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ?",Y
4,4785,"I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural .",N
5,4785,"Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well .",Y
6,4785,I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing .,N
7,4785,I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive .,N
8,4785,"You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts !",Y
9,4785,Really ?,N
10,4785,Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! __eou__,N
0,4786,"Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do !",N
1,4786,I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help .,N
2,4786,What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ?,N
3,4786,"I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well .",Y
4,4786,Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .,N
5,4786,"Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? __eou__",Y
0,4787,"Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick .",N
1,4787,"Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything .",N
2,4787,"Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .",N
3,4787,"I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative .",Y
4,4787,I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .,N
5,4787,"You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore",N
6,4787,"Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .",Y
7,4787,Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories .,N
8,4787,Love stories ? More like one-night-stands .,Y
9,4787,"Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints .",N
10,4787,My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ?,N
11,4787,"You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . __eou__",N
0,4788,"Honey , I ’ ll be right back !",N
1,4788,Where are you going ?,N
2,4788,I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done .,N
3,4788,"Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?",N
4,4788,"Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !",Y
5,4788,Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !,N
6,4788,"They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !",Y
7,4788,"Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . __eou__",Y
0,4789,"Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ?",N
1,4789,haven't been sleeping well recently .,N
2,4789,what's the problem ?,N
3,4789,every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings .,Y
4,4789,"well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down .",Y
5,4789,"yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon .",N
6,4789,"I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept",Y
7,4789,"yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time . __eou__",Y
0,4790,"Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you .",N
1,4790,I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend .,N
2,4790,don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime .,Y
3,4790,thanks for understanding .,N
4,4790,"well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ?",Y
5,4790,"hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .",Y
6,4790,"Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves .",N
7,4790,"I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .",Y
8,4790,maybe ... I'll think about it . __eou__,Y
0,4791,"Hi Mary , how's it going ?",N
1,4791,"well , last night I had a big argument with Ann .",N
2,4791,terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends .,N
3,4791,"now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper .",N
4,4791,really ? What happened ?,N
5,4791,"it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee",N
6,4791,that's pretty harsh .,N
7,4791,"I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?",N
8,4791,you know she probably feels just as bad .,Y
9,4791,"well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often .",Y
10,4791,"well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want .",Y
11,4791,"yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up . __eou__",Y
0,4792,the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off .,N
1,4792,that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines .,Y
2,4792,great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal .,Y
3,4792,do you prefer brandy or ports .,N
4,4792,"port , please .",N
5,4792,excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor .,N
6,4792,the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ?,N
7,4792,yes . You always have a good nose for wines .,N
8,4792,next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine .,Y
9,4792,"oh , what's that ?",N
10,4792,it's made from naturally frozen grapes .,Y
11,4792,why not ? It sounds great .,Y
12,4792,"oh , here's to your health .",N
13,4792,thanks . Cheers .,N
14,4792,cheers . __eou__,N
0,4793,"we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ?",N
1,4793,I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ?,N
2,4793,"oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's .",N
3,4793,Jack ?,N
4,4793,"yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ?",Y
5,4793,I will never go out with him anymore .,N
6,4793,why did you say so ?,N
7,4793,"last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all !",N
8,4793,"oh , really ?",N
9,4793,he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly .,N
10,4793,are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ?,N
11,4793,it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him .,N
12,4793,what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ?,N
13,4793,I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much .,N
14,4793,maybe he should really something about eating etiquette .,Y
15,4793,"oh , he really should . __eou__",N
0,4794,I can ’ t believe it !,N
1,4794,What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal .,N
2,4794,"Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !",N
3,4794,Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then .,N
4,4794,I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .,N
5,4794,What were the odds ?,N
6,4794,"20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !",N
7,4794,Too bad . __eou__,N
0,4795,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !",N
1,4795,What is it ? What happened ?,N
2,4795,I think someone is stalking me .,N
3,4795,"No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?",N
4,4795,"I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",N
5,4795,What did you do ?,N
6,4795,"I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .",N
7,4795,Did he leave when you left ?,N
8,4795,Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .,N
9,4795,What did you do ? __eou__,N
0,4796,He followed me all the way home !,N
1,4796,That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .,N
2,4796,"Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?",N

8,4796,Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__,N
0,4797,"Hi , Bob , everything okay ?",N
1,4797,more or less . There's just one thing bothering me .,Y
2,4797,oh ? What's that ?,N
3,4797,"well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy .",N
4,4797,what gift ?,N
5,4797,"it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift",N
6,4797,you refused the gift ? That's terrible .,N
7,4797,"I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .",N
8,4797,perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .,Y
9,4797,that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . __eou__,N
0,4798,Are you cold ?,N
1,4798,"Yes , a little .",N
2,4798,I wonder if we can change the temperature .,Y
3,4798,I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning .,N
4,4798,There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ?,N
5,4798,I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk .,N
6,4798,"Well , they have it too cold in here . I want to be warmer . I won't be able to sleep .",N
7,4798,I'm going downstairs for more drinking water . I will ask them .,N
8,4798,What did they say about the air conditioning ?,N
9,4798,They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it .,N
10,4798,That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ?,N
11,4798,You can wear more clothes . __eou__,N
0,4799,"I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper .",N
1,4799,What happened ?,N
2,4799,It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans .,N
3,4799,That's serious .,N
4,4799,"I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down .",Y
5,4799,So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much .,N
6,4799,"Yes , it's an amazing drop .",N
7,4799,Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us .,N
8,4799,"Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ?",Y
9,4799,"Yes , and you know what ?",Y
10,4799,What ?,N
11,4799,"I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ?",Y
12,4799,Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . __eou__,Y
0,4800,I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing !,N
1,4800,Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! __eou__,N
0,4801,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !",N
1,4801,What ? What did you buy ?,N
2,4801,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !,N
3,4801,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?,N
4,4801,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .",N
5,4801,And ?,N
6,4801,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .,N
7,4801,And it's a brick ?,N
8,4801,Yes .,N
9,4801,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?,N
10,4801,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .",N
11,4801,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .,N
12,4801,"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .",N
13,4801,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?,Y
14,4801,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .,N
15,4801,"Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",N
16,4801,"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .",Y
17,4801,That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,Y
18,4801,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__",N

4,4892,"You are not going to give it up , are you ?",N
5,4892,"No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either .",N
6,4892,I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it .,Y
7,4892,"Yes , but whom to ?",N
8,4892,"Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .",Y
9,4892,"That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees .",N
10,4892,"Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then .",Y
11,4892,"Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . __eou__",N

7,4896,You got me .,N
8,4896,"Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . __eou__",Y
0,4897,"Be quiet , Will you ?",N
1,4897,I'm sorry . __eou__,N

0,4943,The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat .,Y

0,5145,There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ?,N
1,5145,Is it formal or informal ?,N

3,5145,"In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better .",Y
4,5145,You are right . What about shoes ?,Y

3,5147,"That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .",Y
4,5147,Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?,N
5,5147,"When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .",Y
6,5147,"I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?",N
7,5147,"Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .",Y

6,5148,You are smart .,N
7,5148,"Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions .",Y
8,5148,You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ?,N

6,5153,"' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ?",Y
7,5153,Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing .,N
8,5153,"Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ?",Y
9,5153,She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang .,N
10,5153,"Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking .",Y
11,5153,You are such an expert on it . I don't know that .,N
12,5153,"You know , interest is the best teacher .",Y
13,5153,"So , want me to book the tickets again ?",N
14,5153,Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing .,N
15,5153,We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend .,Y
16,5153,That will be great . __eou__,N
0,5154,What are you doing ?,N
1,5154,I'm surfing the Net . __eou__,N
0,5155,We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .,N
1,5155,"I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .",N
2,5155,Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?,Y
3,5155,Why not ? I'd love to do that .,Y
4,5155,Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ),Y
5,5155,Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?,N
6,5155,Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?,N
7,5155,I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that .,N
8,5155,"No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .",N
9,5155,Unbelievable ! I could never do that .,N
10,5155,Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum .,N
11,5155,Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ?,N
12,5155,"Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ?",Y

2,5156,"Yeah , he is going to move next month .",N
3,5156,Where is he going ?,N
4,5156,He is going to Canada and to live with his son .,N
5,5156,What a pity !,N
6,5156,Why did you say that ? It's a good thing for him to live with his son .,N
7,5156,I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company .,N
8,5156,Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . __eou__,N
0,5157,There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it .,N
1,5157,I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ?,N
2,5157,"' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language .",Y
3,5157,I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess .,N
4,5157,"Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ?",N
5,5157,"Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant .",Y
6,5157,Those young actors play the roles perfectly .,N
7,5157,I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ?,N
8,5157,"No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it .",N
9,5157,Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . __eou__,Y
0,5158,What happened to that girl you were seeing ?,N
1,5158,Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week .,N
2,5158,That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago .,N
3,5158,It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho .,N
4,5158,What do you mean ?,N
5,5158,"She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that .",N
6,5158,She sounds very emotional .,Y
7,5158,"She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place .",N
8,5158,Were you suppose to be there ?,N
9,5158,I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this .,N
10,5158,Ok . You're right . She's a psycho .,N
11,5158,I'm just glad it's over . __eou__,N

4,5160,What a heavy snow !,N
5,5160,Take care ! Don't slip down to the ground .,N
6,5160,I've got it . I like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .,Y
7,5160,Yes . Very wonderful .,N
8,5160,Do you smell the sweet scent ?,N
9,5160,Yes . It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms .,Y
10,5160,The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness . __eou__,N
0,5161,What part did you get in the play this time ?,N
1,5161,I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes .,Y
2,5161,I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite .,Y
3,5161,Are you kidding ? You got the leading role .,N
4,5161,"I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A .",N
5,5161,I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A .,N
6,5161,Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script .,N
7,5161,I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while . __eou__,Y
0,5162,Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie .,N

4,5162,The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie .,N
5,5162,"Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important .",Y
6,5162,"My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat .",N
7,5162,"My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning .",Y
8,5162,You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . __eou__,Y

1,5165,"How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same .",N
2,5165,"The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now .",Y
3,5165,"Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ?",Y
4,5165,Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes .,Y
5,5165,"I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ?",Y
6,5165,"Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you .",Y
7,5165,"If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . __eou__",Y
0,5166,Hey Jackie . What are you doing ?,N
1,5166,Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ?,N

8,5167,"Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise .",Y
9,5167,But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage .,N

3,5172,"Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ?",N
4,5172,"Yes , that's her .",N
5,5172,"I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ?",N
6,5172,"Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle .",N
7,5172,"Oh , I am from London as well .",N
8,5172,Where in London do you live ?,N
9,5172,In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis .,Y

6,5173,Good . I will have hot chocolate .,N
7,5173,A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green .,N
8,5173,When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you .,N

0,5174,Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ?,N
1,5174,"Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat .",N
2,5174,When did you decide to become a vegetarian ?,N
3,5174,I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since .,N
4,5174,That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ?,N
5,5174,"Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them .",Y
6,5174,"You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ?",N
7,5174,I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great !,Y
8,5174,How do you get enough protein in your diet ?,N
9,5174,"Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish .",Y
10,5174,"Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ?",Y
11,5174,"I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it .",N
12,5174,How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ?,Y
13,5174,That sounds great . What time should I come over ?,N

8,5176,How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ?,N
9,5176,"I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips .",Y

7,5227,Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all .,N
8,5227,C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls .,N
9,5227,"Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation .",Y
10,5227,What do I talk about ?,N
11,5227,It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that .,Y
12,5227,I don't know ...,N
13,5227,Do you want me to go talk to her ?,N
14,5227,No . Stay away from her .,N
15,5227,"If you don't do anything , I'll bet somebody else will .",Y
16,5227,Ok already . I'll try . __eou__,N
0,5228,You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are !,N
1,5228,Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident .,N

4,5228,You're serious ?,N
5,5228,"Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert .",N
6,5228,I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me .,N
7,5228,"Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ? __eou__",Y
0,5229,"Hey , Sandy . Do you want to go to the ETV with us ?",N
1,5229,"I'd love to , but I'm broke . Maybe after payday . __eou__",Y
0,5230,Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ?,Y
1,5230,"If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln .",Y
2,5230,"He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ?",Y
3,5230,That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals .,N
4,5230,That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected .,N
5,5230,And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights .,Y
6,5230,"He had great vision , didn't he ?",Y
7,5230,And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . __eou__,Y
0,5231,"Hey , let's arm wrestle !",N

1,5232,Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ?,N
2,5232,Really ? When did you decide this ?,N
3,5232,"I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it .",N
4,5232,"That's exciting , man .",Y
5,5232,So how did you propose ?,N
6,5232,You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now .,N
7,5232,What do you think I should do ?,N
8,5232,"There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .",Y
9,5232,I never thought about that .,Y
10,5232,Thought about what ?,Y
11,5232,Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ?,Y
12,5232,I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend .,N
13,5232,"I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man .",N
14,5232,Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . __eou__,N

0,5234,Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ?,N
1,5234,Why do I need to do that ?,N
2,5234,"My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect .",Y
3,5234,"Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ?",N
4,5234,My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ?,N
5,5234,Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere .,N
6,5234,That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ?,Y
7,5234,Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board . __eou__,Y
0,5235,"Jack , could you check your calendar ?",N
1,5235,"Sure , what's going on ?",Y
2,5235,"We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone .",N
3,5235,"Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . __eou__",N

4,5237,I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back .,N
5,5237,How Ay people will be there at dinner ?,N
6,5237,Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters .,N
7,5237,"That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . __eou__",N
0,5238,"Hey Annie , who is this picture of ?",N

3,5238,Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself .,N
4,5238,Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ?,Y
5,5238,He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom .,N

2,5239,Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ?,N
3,5239,Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school .,N
4,5239,What position did you play ?,N
5,5239,"I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base .",N
6,5239,I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast .,N
7,5239,"It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ?",N
8,5239,I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces .,N
9,5239,"I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here .",Y
10,5239,"I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ?",Y
11,5239,When do you guys play ?,N
12,5239,We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays .,N
13,5239,Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . __eou__,N
0,5240,What sports do you like to play ?,N
1,5240,I like baseball and basketball .,N
2,5240,How about football ?,Y
3,5240,"In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger .",Y
4,5240,It's a very popular game in America .,N
5,5240,Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ?,N
6,5240,"For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .",Y
7,5240,Are you a football player ?,N
8,5240,"No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football .",N
9,5240,What is two hand touch and flag football ?,N
10,5240,"Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .",Y
11,5240,I see . It's safer then right ?,N
12,5240,"Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us .",Y
13,5240,I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together .,Y
14,5240,Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning .,N
15,5240,Great . __eou__,N
0,5241,Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ?,N

2,5241,Do you already have a foursome ?,N
3,5241,"Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work .",N
4,5241,That sounds good . Where do you want to play ?,Y
5,5241,"We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work .",Y
6,5241,How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close .,Y
7,5241,How much does it cost over there ?,N
8,5241,Twilight rates are 21 dollars .,N
9,5241,That's pretty good . Let's do it .,Y
10,5241,Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4,N
11,5241,Make it 4,N
12,5241,Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time .,N
13,5241,Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then .,N
14,5241,Aright . Have fun on Saturday .,N

0,5242,Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ?,N
1,5242,"Oh , you don't ask much , do you ?",N
2,5242,I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition .,N
3,5242,I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones .,Y
4,5242,That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us .,N
5,5242,Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting !,Y
6,5242,Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it .,N
7,5242,Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . __eou__,Y
0,5243,Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ?,N
1,5243,You bet . I'm really excited . __eou__,Y
0,5244,Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas .,Y
1,5244,What did you have in mind ?,Y
2,5244,I don't know yet .,N
3,5244,I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap .,Y
4,5244,I know what you mean .,N
5,5244,I want to give a gift that is really meaningful .,Y
6,5244,Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them .,Y
7,5244,Or what only we are able to give them . __eou__,Y
0,5245,There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ?,N
1,5245,What are the movies that are playing ?,N
2,5245,There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon .,Y

4,5245,"So , is that a yes ?",N
5,5245,Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ?,N
6,5245,"It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main .",N
7,5245,Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! __eou__,N
0,5246,"Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ?",N
1,5246,"Hello , there , my name is Tonia .",N
2,5246,Do you sing alto ?,N
3,5246,"Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you .",Y
4,5246,Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone .,N
5,5246,Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them .,Y
6,5246,I heard them warming up earlier . You're right .,N
7,5246,It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone ! __eou__,Y
0,5247,It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon .,N
1,5247,That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . __eou__,N
0,5248,The weather has been terrible this week .,N
1,5248,"Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled .",N
2,5248,Let's hope it clears up . __eou__,N
0,5249,We'd like to have a look around your house ?,Y
1,5249,"Yes , of course , please follow me .",N
2,5249,Thank you .,N
3,5249,This is our courtyard .,N
4,5249,"It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ?",N
5,5249,"Yes , about 46 square metres .",N
6,5249,Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ?,N
7,5249,Yes .,N
8,5249,Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ?,N
9,5249,"They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time .",Y
10,5249,Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . __eou__,Y
0,5250,"Hello , this is David .",N
1,5250,"Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ?",N
2,5250,Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ?,Y
3,5250,That will work .,N
4,5250,Does five thirty work for you ?,N
5,5250,That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time .,N
6,5250,Is it the plans for my new house ?,N
7,5250,Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . __eou__,N
0,5251,What stresses you out the most ?,N
1,5251,Probably my parents .,N
2,5251,How so ?,N
3,5251,"Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married .",Y
4,5251,You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents .,N
5,5251,Your parents are not like that ?,N
6,5251,"Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much .",N
7,5251,You're lucky .,N
8,5251,What do you do to deal with the stress ?,Y
9,5251,"Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning .",N
10,5251,That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ?,N
11,5251,Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . __eou__,Y
0,5252,"It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose .",Y
1,5252,Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ?,N
2,5252,"Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .",Y
3,5252,Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds !,N
4,5252,What other activities will you have tomorrow ?,N
5,5252,"Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .",Y
6,5252,Do you bring some gifts along ?,N
7,5252,"That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand .",Y
8,5252,Is it the same practice for all families ?,N
9,5252,"Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .",Y
10,5252,I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax .,N
11,5252,"Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . __eou__",Y
0,5253,"Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ?",N
1,5253,He's in the hospital resting . The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet .,N
2,5253,I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can .,N
3,5253,I hope so .,N
4,5253,You must feel really worried right now . But you know your dad is a fighter .,N
5,5253,Yeah . I think my mom is the most worried . I'm basically worried about how she is doing .,N
6,5253,Where is she right now ?,N
7,5253,She's in the hospital with my dad . I have to go back tonight .,N
8,5253,"Hey , I'll go with you .",Y
9,5253,You don't have to .,N
10,5253,It's really no problem .,N
11,5253,Ok . Let's go right after dinner . __eou__,Y
0,5254,My name's McDonald .,N
1,5254,"Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ?",N
2,5254,"It's M , C , capital D . __eou__",N
0,5255,There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month .,N
1,5255,What kind of food will they be serving ?,N
2,5255,"My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo .",Y
3,5255,It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .,Y
4,5255,I can hardly wait !,N
5,5255,Do you know the day they plan to open ?,N
6,5255,I'll double check the announcement .,N
7,5255,Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ? __eou__,Y
0,5256,"Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner .",Y
1,5256,We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival .,N
2,5256,"My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month .",Y
3,5256,What do you think we can see during the festival ?,Y
4,5256,"I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations .",Y
5,5256,I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park .,N
6,5256,"Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows .",Y
7,5256,"Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . __eou__",Y
0,5257,"He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know .",Y
1,5257,You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ?,N
2,5257,"No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . __eou__",N
0,5258,I have an idea for Christmas this year .,Y
1,5258,What is it ?,N
2,5258,Let's not exchange any gifts at all .,N
3,5258,You big scrooge !,N
4,5258,Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it !,Y
5,5258,But you may have some trouble convincing the kids .,N
6,5258,"Actual 1y , it was their idea first .",N
7,5258,Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . __eou__,N
0,5259,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?,N
1,5259,"Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .",Y
2,5259,Of course . __eou__,Y
0,5260,"I'll see you in Sterlet , then .",N
1,5260,Where did you say ?,N
2,5260,"Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y .",N
3,5260,Right . __eou__,N
0,5261,Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract .,N
1,5261,Sure . I've got a copy here . It's due for renewal at the end of next month . We've still got time to look for another supplier if you're not happy . __eou__,Y
0,5262,What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan .,Y
1,5262,"Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin .",Y
2,5262,Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .,Y
3,5262,While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries .,Y
4,5262,That is a really interesting fact .,N
5,5262,I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach .,N
6,5262,Just do whatever you feel like doing .,Y
7,5262,( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree .,Y
8,5262,Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade .,Y
9,5262,I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . __eou__,N
0,5263,Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week .,Y
1,5263,"Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too .",Y
2,5263,How can we get there ?,Y
3,5263,We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station .,Y
4,5263,OK ! Let's go .,N
5,5263,( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge .,N
6,5263,"Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan .",N
7,5263,"Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects .",Y
8,5263,Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas .,Y
9,5263,We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn .,N
10,5263,It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ? __eou__,N
0,5264,I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday .,N
1,5264,Let's plan a surprise party for him !,Y
2,5264,Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ?,Y
3,5264,That's easy . Anything else ?,N
4,5264,"Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ?",Y
5,5264,Won't he be surprised !,Y
6,5264,I don't know how old he is though .,N
7,5264,That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! __eou__,Y

3,5283,"It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ?",N
4,5283,"Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . __eou__",Y
0,5284,"Hey , Dora ! What kind of books do you like to read ?",Y
1,5284,I read everything I can get my hands on but I like love stories best . What do you think about the love stories ?,Y
2,5284,"I hate to tell you this , but they are nothing but sob stories .",N
3,5284,I don't think so . I like them . Then what's your favorite book ?,N
4,5284,I'm fond of history books .,N
5,5284,"Oh , the history books are dull to me . __eou__",Y
0,5285,I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ?,Y
1,5285,"Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight .",Y
2,5285,Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ?,N
3,5285,"Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint .",Y
4,5285,"So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ?",N

3,5286,Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat .,N
4,5286,Who do you think will be elected ?,N
5,5286,It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes .,N
6,5286,"I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech .",N
7,5286,Maybe . Who knows ? __eou__,Y
0,5287,Is the lake very polluted ?,N

0,5288,Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ?,N
1,5288,I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason .,N
2,5288,Really ? Say it !,N
3,5288,"Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ?",N
4,5288,"Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family .",N
5,5288,"Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man .",N
6,5288,"Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves .",Y

4,5289,Who knows ? You can't judge a book by its cover .,Y
5,5289,Maybe ! __eou__,Y
0,5290,I could get along fine without all the office politics .,Y
1,5290,What's going on ?,N
2,5290,There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking .,N
3,5290,So what happened ?,N
4,5290,We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees .,N
5,5290,So what does that have to do with this position ?,N
6,5290,Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted .,N
7,5290,All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . __eou__,N
0,5291,"Julia , what do you think of the network ?",N
1,5291,"Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails .",Y
2,5291,"Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword .",Y
3,5291,What do you mean ?,N
4,5291,"I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc .",Y
5,5291,"I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm .",Y

0,5293,"Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ?",Y
1,5293,I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it .,Y
2,5293,But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker !,N
3,5293,"Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not .",Y
4,5293,But ... But ...,N
5,5293,"But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue .",Y

3,5295,How did you like the movie ?,N
4,5295,I thought it was pretty good .,N
5,5295,I can't say I agree .,N
6,5295,You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding .,N
7,5295,"I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed .",N
8,5295,It might be . __eou__,Y
0,5296,"I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad .",N

2,5296,"I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better .",Y

2,5299,"But for me , the training is waste of my precious time .",N
3,5299,"I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company __eou__",Y

3,5300,"I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it .",N
4,5300,But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week .,N
5,5300,Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty .,N
6,5300,"My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie .",N
7,5300,What's it about ?,N
8,5300,It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy .,Y

3,5351,I know . But your way doesn't touch my heart .,Y
4,5351,"Oh , god , please tell me how .",N
5,5351,I can't tell you .,N
6,5351,"OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you .",Y
7,5351,"When I am angry and want to beat someone , you stand there and let me do what I want . Would you ?",N
8,5351,"Yes , I would . Thanks for being in my life .",N
9,5351,"Don't be so happy , it is just one of my tests ! __eou__",N
0,5352,Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms !,N
1,5352,I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble .,N
2,5352,Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high !,N
3,5352,No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ?,N
4,5352,Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest .,Y
5,5352,That's exactly where I was planning to go !,N
6,5352,"Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . __eou__",Y
0,5353,"This is tough to say , John , but I think we should break up .",N
1,5353,Are you serious ?,N
2,5353,"Yes , I mean it .",N
3,5353,But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?,N
4,5353,"No , we are just too different . This relationship isn't going anywhere .",N
5,5353,"Hey , come on . It's too early to say that . We can fix things .",Y
6,5353,I have thought about it for a long time . I think it's time to move on for both of us .,Y
7,5353,But I still love you .,N
8,5353,I'm sorry .,N
9,5353,I knew this would happen some day ...,N
10,5353,Then why didn't you talk to me ?,N
11,5353,"Well . It's not all my fault , Anna ...",N
12,5353,"I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends .",N
13,5353,Have you made the decision yet ?,N
14,5353,I think we'll be better off if we are apart .,Y
15,5353,Then shall we keep pure friendship ?,Y
16,5353,"Sure , let's just be friends . __eou__",Y
0,5354,"Hi , Jack , how have you been ?",N
1,5354,Not very well .,N
2,5354,Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?,N
3,5354,Nothing .,N
4,5354,"Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .",N
5,5354,"Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .",N
6,5354,"Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .",N
7,5354,"Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .",Y
8,5354,"Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .",Y
9,5354,Maybe you're right .,Y
10,5354,"Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !",Y
11,5354,"Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... __eou__",N
0,5355,You don't look too well . What's going on ?,N
1,5355,I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills .,N
2,5355,I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ?,N
3,5355,"I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it .",N
4,5355,That's tough . What does your wife think about this ?,N
5,5355,"She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well .",N
6,5355,I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do .,Y
7,5355,I really appreciate your help .,N
8,5355,"No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this . __eou__",N
0,5356,Where are you from ?,N
1,5356,I'm from Guangzhou .,N

0,5357,How is everything going with your girlfriend ?,N
1,5357,Didn't I tell you ? It's over !,N
2,5357,"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ?",N
3,5357,"It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up !",N
4,5357,Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?,N
5,5357,"No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !",N
6,5357,What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?,N
7,5357,"I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .",N
8,5357,I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude !,N
9,5357,I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .,N
10,5357,"I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ?",N
11,5357,I guess so .,N
12,5357,So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea ! __eou__,N
0,5358,Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ?,N
1,5358,Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it .,N
2,5358,"What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ?",Y
3,5358,"They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ?",Y
4,5358,"For me , I think starting school was more exciting .",Y
5,5358,Does that mean work isn't that great ?,N
6,5358,"It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it .",Y
7,5358,But work is a huge portion of our lives . I'm looking forward to making it fun .,Y
8,5358,That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce .,N
9,5358,I hope you're right . __eou__,N
0,5359,Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ?,N
1,5359,"Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ?",N
2,5359,"Yes , I do .",N
3,5359,Now I remember . We met at a conference in Tokyo last year . __eou__,N
0,5360,Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ?,N
1,5360,Nothing planned . How about you ?,N
2,5360,Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink .,N
3,5360,"I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too .",Y
4,5360,I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff .,N
5,5360,But we have to work tomorrow .,N
6,5360,We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work .,N

6,5364,The same to you .,N
7,5364,That's great . __eou__,N
0,5365,It's one of the highlights of the match .,N
1,5365,What ?,N
2,5365,The wonderful passing Melaena did .,N
3,5365,Too bad I missed it . __eou__,N
0,5366,"What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ?",N
1,5366,"Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' .",Y
2,5366,"Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation .",Y
3,5366,I still think nobody plays for nothing . __eou__,N
0,5367,"What's up , buddy ? You look so upset .",N
1,5367,I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ?,N
2,5367,I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ?,N
3,5367,"I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did .",N
4,5367,Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call .,Y
5,5367,"I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet .",N
6,5367,"Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . __eou__",Y
0,5368,A beautiful center !,Y
1,5368,And good shot !,N
2,5368,A goal ! __eou__,Y
0,5369,"Mary , how was your date with John ?",N
1,5369,It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common .,N
2,5369,"Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ?",N
3,5369,"He is tall and slim , fair-haired .",N

5,5369,He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous .,N
6,5369,"Oh , it ’ s love at first sight . __eou__",N
0,5370,I hope the host team loses .,N
1,5370,That all depends on how the visiting team shapes .,N
2,5370,"According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America .",N
3,5370,But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . __eou__,N
0,5371,What do you think of the former champ ?,N
1,5371,"There were some bad misses in his defence , so he lost it .",N
2,5371,No champion can remain at the top for ever .,Y
3,5371,I suppose he's not in top form . __eou__,N
0,5372,What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ?,N
1,5372,They aren't evenly matched .,N
2,5372,"Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole .",N
3,5372,Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet . __eou__,Y
0,5373,"Steve , when are you going back to America ?",N
1,5373,Next week .,N
2,5373,"Wow , so soon ! I'm going to miss you . __eou__",N
0,5374,"I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa .",N
1,5374,"Not at all , Sam .",N
2,5374,"I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . __eou__",N
0,5375,I hear you're going to Tainan to visit your uncle .,N
1,5375,That's correct .,N
2,5375,"Well , say hello to him for me . __eou__",N
0,5376,Wow ! Look at the time . lt's about 11 0 ' clock .,N

2,5376,I've got to catch the last bus . See you later . __eou__,N
0,5377,Are you still at that work ?,N
1,5377,"Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job .",Y
2,5377,What sort of job do you have in mind ?,Y
3,5377,I think I'm quite fit for a driver .,N
4,5377,But it's very tired .,N
5,5377,I don't care .,N
6,5377,What's your parents ' opinion ?,N
7,5377,I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation . __eou__,Y
0,5378,What do you do now ?,N
1,5378,I'm out of work at the moment .,N
2,5378,Why ?,N
3,5378,I was fired last week .,N
4,5378,I'm sorry to hear that .,N
5,5378,It doesn't matter .,N
6,5378,What's your plan now ?,N
7,5378,After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job .,Y
8,5378,Best wishes for you .,N
9,5378,Thank you . __eou__,N
0,5379,I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ?,N
1,5379,"Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife .",N
2,5379,What ?,N
3,5379,His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion .,N
4,5379,"Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well .",Y
5,5379,"Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it ’ s just one of those things . __eou__",N
0,5380,Can you tell which team seems to win ?,N
1,5380,Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor .,N
2,5380,Yes . Our guest team is really tough .,N
3,5380,They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see . __eou__,N
0,5381,We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States .,N
1,5381,"Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch . __eou__",N
0,5382,"OK , Hello !",N
1,5382,Hello !,N
2,5382,"Hi , what's your name ?",N
3,5382,"Yeah , my name is Nandu .",N
4,5382,"Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ?",N
5,5382,"Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U .",N
6,5382,"Oh , OK . That's a nice name , Nandu . And where are you from ?",N
7,5382,I'm from Madras . __eou__,N
0,5383,What's the score ?,N
1,5383,The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half .,N
2,5383,The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final .,N
3,5383,It doesn't seem to be so easy . __eou__,N
0,5384,Is the Chinese team taking the lead ?,N
1,5384,"No , it's the Japanese team .",N
2,5384,Japanese teams always play a dark horse .,N
3,5384,"Well , their team work is well worth learning . __eou__",Y
0,5385,The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .,N
1,5385,They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .,N
2,5385,"If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .",N
3,5385,"No way , if it still has 21 . __eou__",N
0,5386,"In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ?",N
1,5386,"Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks .",N
2,5386,Is this your best score ?,N
3,5386,"No , once I did 32 . __eou__",N
0,5387,I think he deserved his gold .,N
1,5387,Did you see his last dive .,N
2,5387,"Yes , it's perfect !",N
3,5387,He's diving for the gold . __eou__,N
0,5388,Hey Mike . What are you doing ?,N
1,5388,Nothing much . What are you up to ?,N
2,5388,I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately .,N
3,5388,He took the civil service exam and failed .,N
4,5388,That sucks . He must feel depressed .,N
5,5388,Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days .,N
6,5388,Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him .,Y
7,5388,That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else .,Y
8,5388,Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done .,N
9,5388,Sounds good . __eou__,N
0,5389,Which team won ?,N
1,5389,The Spur .,Y
2,5389,What was the score ?,N
3,5389,They managed a 99:80 victory . __eou__,N
0,5390,It's quiet everywhere in winter .,N
1,5390,Yes . I like winter .,N
2,5390,Me too .,N
3,5390,It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?,Y
4,5390,That's a good idea . Let's go !,Y
5,5390,What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .,Y
6,5390,Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .,N
7,5390,I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .,Y
8,5390,Yes . Very wonderful .,N
9,5390,There is a snowman over there .,N
10,5390,How lovely it is ! __eou__,N
0,5391,I'm sure he was off-side .,N
1,5391,But the ref didn't whistle .,N
2,5391,I think he favors the host team .,N
3,5391,"Anyway , the host team seems to fight for the gold . __eou__",Y
0,5392,Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ?,N
1,5392,"Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep .",N
2,5392,Didn't you bring his favorite toy ?,N
3,5392,"Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms .",Y
4,5392,Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan .,N
5,5392,"My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good .",N
6,5392,You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming .,Y
7,5392,"Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten .",N
8,5392,His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir .,Y
9,5392,"And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . __eou__",N
0,5393,Which team has won ?,N
1,5393,Neither . The game ended in two all .,N
2,5393,But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized .,N
3,5393,But the Brazilian is tougher . __eou__,N
0,5394,I like the kid . He's so lovely .,N
1,5394,How old is he ?,N
2,5394,Twelve . He's very sensible for his age . __eou__,N
0,5395,"In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy .",Y
1,5395,Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress .,Y
2,5395,"Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long .",Y
3,5395,"That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool .",Y
4,5395,"I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas .",Y
5,5395,"In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested .",Y
6,5395,And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity !,Y
7,5395,"Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ?",Y
8,5395,"Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year .",Y
9,5395,Maybe you are right . __eou__,Y
0,5396,"What are your hobbies , Mr . Green ?",Y
1,5396,I like collecting stamps .,N
2,5396,"But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ?",N
3,5396,"Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ?",N
4,5396,I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best .,Y
5,5396,Do you play basketball well ?,N
6,5396,"No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it .",N
7,5396,Shall we have a game together some day ?,Y
8,5396,"OK , that'd be very nice . __eou__",N
0,5397,"Hey , Mary , what's up ?",N
1,5397,"Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight .",N
2,5397,"Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ?",N
3,5397,"Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .",Y
4,5397,It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?,Y
5,5397,"There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends .",Y
6,5397,"Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty .",Y
7,5397,I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .,N
8,5397,"Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__",Y
0,5398,What do you like to do in your spare time ?,N
1,5398,"I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos .",Y
2,5398,What kind of dance do you like ?,Y
3,5398,I like rumba and tango .,N
4,5398,Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me .,N
5,5398,You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier .,Y
6,5398,"OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ?",N
7,5398,"Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ?",Y
8,5398,"I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn .",Y
9,5398,Sounds pleasant . __eou__,N
0,5399,"Mary , how was your date with john ?",N
1,5399,It's OK . It seems we have a lot in common .,N
2,5399,"Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ?",N
3,5399,"He is tall and slim , fair-haired .",N
4,5399,Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ?,N
5,5399,He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor .,N
6,5399,"Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ?",N

4,5539,"I agree , I had lunch there last week .",N
5,5539,excellent ! That sounds like a plan . __eou__,Y
0,5540,Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ?,N
1,5540,"Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ?",N
2,5540,"That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them .",N
3,5540,Matinee or evening ?,N
4,5540,Evening .,N
5,5540,Circle or stalls ?,Y
6,5540,Stalls .,N
7,5540,"Wonderful , I'll go with you . __eou__",Y
0,5541,Is there anything available for tonight ?,N
1,5541,There are some seats in the rear mezzanine .,N
2,5541,Isn't there anything else available ?,N
3,5541,"No , the show is almost sold out . __eou__",N
0,5542,"Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?",N
1,5542,That sounds great . Where are you going ?,N
2,5542,"I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .",Y
3,5542,What should I bring ?,N
4,5542,Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything . __eou__,Y
0,5543,"So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ?",N
1,5543,"Well , that's hard to say because there are so many good ones . I don't think I could pick a favorite .",Y
2,5543,"You know what comedy I really like ? "" Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . "" I think Jim Carry is really funny .",Y
3,5543,"Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever .",N
4,5543,"I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is "" Titanic . "" __eou__",N
0,5544,"You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ?",N
1,5544,"Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting .",Y
2,5544,Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out .,N
3,5544,"It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out .",Y
4,5544,"Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . __eou__",Y
0,5545,Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ?,N
1,5545,That would be fine . Where are you going ?,N
2,5545,We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing .,Y
3,5545,Great .,N
4,5545,And don't forget your fishing tackle .,N
5,5545,Ok . I like fishing very much . __eou__,N
0,5546,You like Titanic ? That movie is so cheesy .,N
1,5546,"It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week .",Y
2,5546,"Really ? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy .",N
3,5546,"Alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . But come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ?",Y
4,5546,"Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially "" Terminator . """,Y
5,5546,"Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ?",N
6,5546,"Well ... I saw it only once , but for the next two months when I talked to people , I pretended I was the Terminator . __eou__",Y
0,5547,Will we drive to the seaside ?,N
1,5547,"Yes , it will take about four hours . We can leave about noon and get there by supper time .",N
2,5547,Let me help pay for gas .,Y
3,5547,All right . There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third .,N
4,5547,What other expenses will we have ?,N
5,5547,There won't be many other expenses expect food . __eou__,N
0,5548,"Well now that I know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ?",N
1,5548,I don't really like sci-fi movies because they're always really weird .,N
2,5548,"I know ! I don't get them at all . But wait , isn't ' Terminator ' a sci-fi movie ?",Y
3,5548,"Hmm ... you're right . Well , I guess ' Terminator ' is an exception to the rule . __eou__",Y
0,5549,"Good morning , you look very tired .",N
1,5549,"Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night .",N
2,5549,Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?,N
3,5549,"No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock .",N
4,5549,"I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges .",N
5,5549,The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles .,Y
6,5549,Do you have much time watching TV ?,N
7,5549,I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio .,N
8,5549,"I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station .",Y
9,5549,"If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . __eou__",Y
0,5550,What did you do over the weekend ?,N
1,5550,I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .,Y
2,5550,Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?,Y
3,5550,"It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .",Y
4,5550,Like what ?,N
5,5550,"Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .",Y
6,5550,What else can we do to protect the environment ?,Y
7,5550,"If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy .",Y
8,5550,How about recycling ? Does that actually help ?,Y
9,5550,"Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .",Y
10,5550,What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?,N
11,5550,I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .,Y
12,5550,I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !,N
13,5550,"To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__",Y
0,5551,Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !,N
1,5551,"Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .",N
2,5551,"Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .",Y
3,5551,"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .",Y
4,5551,Me too .,N
5,5551,"Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .",N
6,5551,"Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?",Y
7,5551,"Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .",Y
8,5551,"He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .",N
9,5551,And the host announced that he won it all ! __eou__,N
0,5552,The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !,N
1,5552,Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .,Y
2,5552,"On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .",Y
3,5552,"As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .",Y
4,5552,"I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect .",Y
5,5552,What is the greenhouse effect exactly ?,Y
6,5552,It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .,Y
7,5552,"I see , so it's similar to global warming ?",N
8,5552,"They're related to one another , yes .",N
9,5552,I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .,Y
10,5552,"People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .",Y
11,5552,People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .,Y
12,5552,"I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . __eou__",Y
0,5553,Hello,N
1,5553,"Hi Angela , it's Dan .",N
2,5553,Hi B . How are you ?,N
3,5553,Good .,N
4,5553,I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ?,N
5,5553,"Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off .",N
6,5553,"No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ?",N
7,5553,"Oh , is that next week ?",N
8,5553,Yes . Did you forget ?,N
9,5553,"No , of course not . I already bought them a present .",N
10,5553,"That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me .",Y
11,5553,Sure . Does she know your friend ?,N
12,5553,"Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other .",N
13,5553,Are we all going to drive together ?,N
14,5553,"Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . __eou__",N
0,5554,I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .,Y
1,5554,"Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry .",N
2,5554,"We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .",Y
3,5554,The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it .,Y
4,5554,I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? __eou__,Y
0,5555,"Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ?",N
1,5555,"Certainly , where will you be coming from ?",N
2,5555,I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there .,N
3,5555,Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit .,N
4,5555,Got that .,N
5,5555,"Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right .",N
6,5555,"Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ?",N
7,5555,"No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right .",N
8,5555,"Ok , I can see that road .",N
9,5555,That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library .,N
10,5555,"Good , I can see the library on the map .",N
11,5555,"Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ?",N
12,5555,"That's great , see you at seven . __eou__",N
0,5556,"Craig , what do you do for work ?",Y
1,5556,I'm still a student .,N
2,5556,What school do you go to ?,N
3,5556,Boston University .,N
4,5556,That's a good school . What do you study ?,N
5,5556,"I'm studying English , math , and history . My major is English .",N
6,5556,How long have you been studying English ?,N
7,5556,More than six years .,N
8,5556,That's a long time .,N
9,5556,"Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school .",N
10,5556,No wonder your English is so good .,N
11,5556,"Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice .",N
12,5556,I see . Talking with other people is very important .,Y
13,5556,"Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet .",N
14,5556,I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come .,N
15,5556,Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come . __eou__,N
0,5557,"Hi , Sara , what are you reading ?",N
1,5557,"Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter .",N
2,5557,Why ?,N
3,5557,"Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard .",Y
4,5557,What for ?,N
5,5557,"So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends .",Y
6,5557,That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ?,Y
7,5557,You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ?,N
8,5557,"Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle .",Y
9,5557,"Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want .",Y
10,5557,"Please go ahead , I am listening .",Y
11,5557,I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .,Y
12,5557,Is your back door higher than the ground level ?,N
13,5557,"Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground .",N
14,5557,"Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail .",Y
15,5557,I don't like things to be fancy .,N
16,5557,Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look .,Y
17,5557,"Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?",Y
18,5557,Cedar is a good choice .,Y
19,5557,"Well , let's take the measurements right now . __eou__",Y
0,5558,"What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ?",N
1,5558,"No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ?",N
2,5558,"I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar .",N
3,5558,"Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar . You like this place ?",N
4,5558,"Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful !",N

6,5558,"Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in .",N
7,5558,"Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ?",Y
8,5558,"Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move .",N
9,5558,"I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention .",Y
10,5558,Cool . Thanks . ( Jimmy brings May a glass of orange juice . ),N
11,5558,"Oh , fresh juice , I love it . Well , I heard American people love hanging out in bars . Is that true ?",N
12,5558,"Not everyone . But a lot of people do , especially the young . It's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends .",Y
13,5558,"Interesting . Hey , look over there . The dance floor is already packed with people . Oh , the girl in red dances great .",N
14,5558,"Yeah , a dancing queen . Wanna go and join them ?",Y
15,5558,Maybe later . I wanna take some photos first .,Y
16,5558,OK . Let me help you to hold the drink .,N
17,5558,Thank you . __eou__,N
0,5559,"Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ?",N
1,5559,"Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ?",N
2,5559,"Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work .",N
3,5559,"I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ?",Y
4,5559,Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good .,N
5,5559,Which one is that ?,N
6,5559,"You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door .",N
7,5559,"Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good .",N
8,5559,Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ?,N
9,5559,What time ?,N
10,5559,At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation .,N
11,5559,That's good . See you on Friday . __eou__,N
0,5560,Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ?,N
1,5560,Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures .,N
2,5560,I feel they all talk and behave in a different way .,Y
3,5560,They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys .,Y
4,5560,Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ?,Y
5,5560,She is certainly not my kind of girl .,N
6,5560,Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes .,N
7,5560,"You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either .",Y

2,5561,Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth .,Y
3,5561,"Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time .",N

5,5561,"Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . __eou__",N

1,5562,Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China .,Y
2,5562,Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ?,Y
3,5562,"Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation .",Y
4,5562,Got it . Can we see any things left by them ?,N
5,5562,Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain .,Y

5,5563,"Of course , have a seat .",N
6,5563,"Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful .",N
7,5563,"Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof .",Y
8,5563,"Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top .",N
9,5563,"Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer .",Y
10,5563,"Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ?",N
11,5563,"Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it . __eou__",N

4,5564,"Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?",Y

6,5564,"Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?",N
7,5564,"Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?",N
8,5564,"Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?",N
9,5564,"Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?",N
10,5564,I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !,N
11,5564,Yes ! __eou__,N
0,5565,I hear you are expecting your family .,N
1,5565,"Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .",N

3,5565,"Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .",N
4,5565,"Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?",N
5,5565,His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .,Y
6,5565,Does your brother have just one son ?,N
7,5565,"No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .",N
8,5565,I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .,N
9,5565,"Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it .",N

4,5566,Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job .,N
5,5566,Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now .,N
6,5566,"Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate .",N
7,5566,Then what should I do ?,N
8,5566,"Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher , the most important is the beauty of mind . You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance . You should appear frugal and prudent . Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer . __eou__",N
0,5567,Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?,N
1,5567,"No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?",N

3,5567,What was that like ?,N
4,5567,It was always very busy there .,N

9,5584,"Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there .",N
10,5584,"Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car .",N
11,5584,So what happened ?,N
12,5584,"Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing .",Y
13,5584,That's terrible .,N
14,5584,"Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ?",Y
15,5584,So what happened next ?,N

18,5584,I'll say . __eou__,N

3,5591,"Oh , no .",N
4,5591,"Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi .",Y
5,5591,So what did you do ?,N
6,5591,"Well , I actually thumbed a lift .",Y
7,5591,You what ?,N
8,5591,"Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport .",N
9,5591,"Wow , good for you .",N
10,5591,"Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight .",N
11,5591,"Oh , no !",N
12,5591,"Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok .",N
13,5591,"You really have bad luck , don't you ?",N
14,5591,Seems like it . __eou__,N
0,5592,"So Kevin , what is your type ?",Y
1,5592,"I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious .",N
2,5592,I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh .,N
3,5592,That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring . __eou__,Y
0,5593,What's the time now ?,N
1,5593,"Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch .",N
2,5593,"You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ?",N

7,5594,"Oh , that's funny !",N
8,5594,"Hang on , I haven't finished yet .",N
9,5594,"Oh , sorry .",N

The Scotsman brought a map . "" If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . "" The Irishman had brought a car door .",Y
11,5594,A car door ? You mean just one car door ?,Y
12,5594,"Yep . A car door . "" Why the door ? "" the others asked him . "" Well , "" he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . "" Do you get it ?",Y
13,5594,Well ... __eou__,N
0,5595,"Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought .",Y
1,5595,"You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football .",N
2,5595,"Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ?",N
3,5595,"The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .",N
4,5595,Wow ! What a hit !,N
5,5595,"Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off .",N
6,5595,Is he ok ?,N
7,5595,"It looks like it , he ’ s getting up .",N
8,5595,I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .,N
9,5595,The Giants ?,N
10,5595,Yeah .,N
11,5595,"Well , here we go again .",N
12,5595,What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?,N

0,5596,"Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?",N

2,5597,How hard is the climb ?,N
3,5597,It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .,N

3,5598,Me too . Do you think we are boring people ?,Y
4,5598,I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .,N
5,5598,That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ?,Y
6,5598,"That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings .",Y
7,5598,I like to play the piano for fun .,Y
8,5598,Yeah . That can be a good hobby .,Y
9,5598,Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do .,Y
10,5598,That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . __eou__,Y

4,5599,Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ?,N
5,5599,"A little , but the rush was worth it .",N
6,5599,Tell me about it .,N
7,5599,We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us .,N
8,5599,500 feet ! I would never be able to do that .,N

6,5602,"Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .",N

8,5602,Which team do you think will win ?,N
9,5602,The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . __eou__,N

3,5603,So ?,N
4,5603,So I think I may fall in love with her .,N
5,5603,That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ?,N
6,5603,Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ?,Y
7,5603,"That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all .",Y
8,5603,That's what I do .,N
9,5603,And you think about her all the time ?,N
10,5603,Yes .,N
11,5603,"And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging .",Y
12,5603,"That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs .",Y
13,5603,"Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate .",N
14,5603,"Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another .",N
15,5603,"Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love .",N
16,5603,"Yeah , falling in love is so good . __eou__",N
0,5604,"So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ?",N
1,5604,"Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him .",N
2,5604,You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ?,N
3,5604,"Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . __eou__",N
0,5605,How about eating out for a drink with me tonight .,Y
1,5605,Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?,N

3,5605,All right . See you tomorrow night . __eou__,N
0,5606,Good game ?,N

3,5606,Absolutely . Who were you playing with ?,N
4,5606,"Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners .",N

8,5606,Jane . Nice to meet you .,N
9,5606,"Me too . So , do you like the course ?",N
10,5606,"Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ?",Y
11,5606,"Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns .",N
12,5606,"Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased .",N
13,5606,"Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them .",N
14,5606,"Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?",Y
15,5606,"Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week !",Y
16,5606,"How awful , poor guy .",N
17,5606,"Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him .",N
18,5606,"Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ?",N
19,5606,Yup . __eou__,N
0,5607,Have you seen this ?,N
1,5607,What ?,N
2,5607,They killed another hostage .,N
3,5607,"Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do .",N
4,5607,I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ?,N
5,5607,"Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us .",Y
6,5607,"Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ?",N
7,5607,"I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed .",Y
8,5607,"Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ?",N
9,5607,"Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things .",Y
10,5607,Really ? What happened ?,N
11,5607,"Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him .",N
12,5607,"Oh , sure . __eou__",Y
0,5608,"William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ?",N
1,5608,"He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well .",N
2,5608,"It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ?",N
3,5608,"I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on .",Y
4,5608,"Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . __eou__",N
0,5609,The weather is terrible .,N
1,5609,Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days .,N
2,5609,I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .,N
3,5609,Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ?,N
4,5609,"I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .",N
5,5609,That sucks so much . What are we going to do ?,N
6,5609,I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain .,Y
7,5609,I'm with you . What do you have in mind ?,Y
8,5609,I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .,Y
9,5609,"That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .",Y
10,5609,Great . I'll stop by your place now .,N
11,5609,Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime . __eou__,N
0,5610,Are you busy with your work ?,N
1,5610,Yes . What about you ?,N
2,5610,"Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime .",N
3,5610,Then your salary must be high .,N
4,5610,Just so so . But we can travel twice every year .,Y
5,5610,Is this time one of them ?,N
6,5610,"Yes , we won't travel again until October .",N
7,5610,Really ? We have only one chance every year . __eou__,Y
0,5611,How's your work ?,N
1,5611,"Good , thanks . How about you ?",N
2,5611,Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately .,N
3,5611,Why ?,N
4,5611,Because of the low salaries .,N
5,5611,But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ?,Y
6,5611,I don't know why .,N
7,5611,Why don't you give them a suggestion ?,Y
8,5611,May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . __eou__,Y
0,5612,"It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ?",N
1,5612,"Yeah . It's already December , you know .",N
2,5612,"Time sure flies , doesn't it ? __eou__",N

2,5613,OK . See you later . __eou__,N
0,5614,Are you travelling in America ?,N
1,5614,"No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business .",N
2,5614,What do you do ?,N
3,5614,I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman .,N
4,5614,I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted .,N
5,5614,Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ?,Y
6,5614,I am a reporter at a TV station .,N
7,5614,Do you like your job ?,N
8,5614,"Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year .",N
9,5614,Which kind of news do you catch ?,N
10,5614,I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades .,Y
11,5614,Are you feel tired ?,N
12,5614,Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing .,Y
13,5614,You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter .,Y
14,5614,That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . __eou__,N
0,5615,"Nice day , isn't it ?",N
1,5615,It sure is .,N
2,5615,It's a good day for a picnic . __eou__,Y
0,5616,"What are you up to tonight , Steve ?",N
1,5616,I'm going to a disco with my friends .,N

2,5617,That'll be fine . See you soon . __eou__,N
0,5618,"Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ?",N
1,5618,Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ?,Y
2,5618,How about Legally Blonde .,Y
3,5618,"Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ?",N
4,5618,Isn't that a scary movie ?,N
5,5618,"How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun .",Y
6,5618,Ok . I'll give it a try .,N
7,5618,That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class .,N
8,5618,Ok . See you tomorrow . __eou__,N

1,5619,"Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ?",N
2,5619,"Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way .",N
3,5619,Hello Paul . I'm Jane . So what do you do ?,N
4,5619,I'm in finance . You ?,N
5,5619,"Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them .",Y
6,5619,"T & D ? Oh , yes , sure . How long have you worked there ?",N

3,5620,I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college .,Y
4,5620,That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby .,Y
5,5620,Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it .,Y

5,5621,"Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies .",N
6,5621,Can I stop by ?,N
7,5621,Sure . Any time . __eou__,N
0,5622,A funny thing happened to me the other day .,N
1,5622,"Oh , yes ?",N
2,5622,"I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again .",Y
3,5622,Mmm .,N
4,5622,"Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him .",Y
5,5622,Really ?,N
6,5622,"Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was .",Y
7,5622,"Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens .",N
8,5622,"You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! __eou__",N
0,5623,Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie ?,N
1,5623,"Oh , yes . You ?",N
2,5623,Yes . What did you think of it ?,N
3,5623,I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ?,Y
4,5623,"I liked it , too . It was scary , but not disgusting . I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . He's brilliant .",N

5,5624,Where would you like to sit ?,N

7,5624,Certainly . __eou__,N
0,5625,Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute .,N
1,5625,"Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ?",Y
2,5625,"Thanks . Gee , it's really light !",N
3,5625,"Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ?",N

6,5625,"Yes , I like collecting antiques .",N
7,5625,Why don't you get a new one ?,N
8,5625,"I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .",Y
9,5625,"Really , what makes you say that ?",N
10,5625,"Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ?",N
11,5625,"Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .",Y
12,5625,"Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?",N
13,5625,Three . Two boys and a girl . __eou__,Y
0,5626,I can ’ t believe it !,N
1,5626,What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal .,N
2,5626,"Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !",N
3,5626,Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then .,N
4,5626,I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure .,N
5,5626,What were the odds ?,N
6,5626,"20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars !",N
7,5626,Too bad . __eou__,N
0,5627,Hey Joanne . What are you up to ?,N
1,5627,I'm just watching some television .,N
2,5627,I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .,N
3,5627,Me too . Do you think we are boring people ?,Y
4,5627,I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .,N
5,5627,That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ?,Y
6,5627,"That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings .",Y
7,5627,I like to play the piano for fun .,Y
8,5627,Yeah . That can be a good hobby .,Y
9,5627,Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do .,Y
10,5627,That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . __eou__,Y
0,5628,Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ?,N
1,5628,"Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me .",Y
2,5628,"Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb .",N
3,5628,"Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William .",N
4,5628,"Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! __eou__",N
0,5629,I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ?,N
1,5629,He's not doing too well .,N
2,5629,Why ? What's wrong ?,N
3,5629,"About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time .",N
4,5629,Is it due to old age or is he sick .,N
5,5629,Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth .,Y
6,5629,That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life .,N
7,5629,That's what my father tells me almost everyday .,N
8,5629,"Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me .",N
9,5629,Thanks . I'll let him know . __eou__,N
0,5630,It's snowing outside .,N

8,5630,But I like cold more than hot .,N
9,5630,You are so interesting . __eou__,N
0,5631,The weather is terrible .,N
1,5631,Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now .,N
2,5631,I'm wearing my heavy jacket .,N
3,5631,"I'm going to put on more clothes , too .",N
4,5631,Will it snow today ?,N
5,5631,I don't know . Do you like snowing ?,N
6,5631,"Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful .",Y
7,5631,You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not .,Y
8,5631,Good idea . __eou__,Y
0,5632,"Henry , I want to ask you something .",N
1,5632,Say what you want to say .,Y
2,5632,"You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money .",N
3,5632,I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you . __eou__,N
0,5633,"Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .",N
1,5633,Stay for dinner with us .,N
2,5633,"I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .",N
3,5633,"Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .",N
4,5633,It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .,N
5,5633,Goodbye . Thank you again for coming . __eou__,N
0,5634,The weather is really miserable . It has been raining hard all day long .,N
1,5634,"Yes , it's so cold .",N
2,5634,Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ?,N
3,5634,"Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon .",N
4,5634,How long does the rainy season last ?,N
5,5634,About two months .,N
6,5634,I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much .,N
7,5634,I'm used to this kind of days .,N
8,5634,But I prefer warm weather .,N
9,5634,Spring will come soon . And we will have some pleasant weather then .,Y
10,5634,I hope so . __eou__,N
0,5635,What do you do when you are angry ?,Y
1,5635,I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger .,Y
2,5635,That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ?,N
3,5635,Something like listening to music is a good idea .,Y
4,5635,"Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?",N
5,5635,Classic . Something that could calm your mind .,Y
6,5635,I think that might work for me as well .,Y
7,5635,Working out is another good way to relieve anger .,Y
8,5635,Like what ?,N
9,5635,"Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . __eou__",Y
0,5636,The time has come to say goodbye .,N
1,5636,So soon . It seems as if you just got here .,N
2,5636,"I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say .",N
3,5636,It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .,N
4,5636,I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around .,N
5,5636,"It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine .",Y
6,5636,"You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ?",N
7,5636,"Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring .",N
8,5636,I'll be expecting you then . __eou__,N
0,5637,What day is today ?,N
1,5637,Today is Thursday .,N
2,5637,What's the date today ?,N
3,5637,"Today is May first , 2003 .",N
4,5637,"Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ?",N
5,5637,"Well , I don't think so . __eou__",N
0,5638,"Hello , Jane !",N

1,5639,"Not bad . How about you , John ?",N
2,5639,Fine . Thank you . __eou__,N
0,5640,Life's so boring .,N
1,5640,"Well , most of the time it is , I guess .",N
2,5640,What do you think will make you happy ?,Y
3,5640,I think money will make me happy .,N
4,5640,You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness .,Y
5,5640,It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do .,Y
6,5640,You'll get bored eventually .,N
7,5640,"Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work .",Y
8,5640,"That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy .",N
9,5640,"You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities . __eou__",Y
0,5641,"Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there !",Y
1,5641,"Really ? Well , thanks for saying so .",N

5,5646,"Oh , she is going to be a great mother . __eou__",N
0,5647,Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ?,N
1,5647,Do you mean lying to people for their good ?,N
2,5647,Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ?,N
3,5647,"It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is .",Y
4,5647,But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth .,N
5,5647,"I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it . __eou__",Y
0,5648,Have you got any hobbies ?,N
1,5648,Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards .,N

1,5691,"I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory .",Y
2,5691,"When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?",Y
3,5691,"Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time .",Y
4,5691,There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?,Y
5,5691,I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground .,Y
6,5691,There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?,Y
7,5691,"I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell .",Y
8,5691,"You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait .",Y
9,5691,"If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . __eou__",Y
0,5692,Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ?,N
1,5692,"No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church .",Y
2,5692,Where do they go ?,N
3,5692,"Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid",Y
4,5692,They go to the home of the bride ?,N
5,5692,Why do you ask ?,N
6,5692,The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite .,Y
7,5692,"Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home .",Y
8,5692,That's very expensive for the family of the bride .,N
9,5692,Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding .,Y
10,5692,Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ?,Y
11,5692,Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married .,Y
12,5692,Maybe I'll be the one . __eou__,Y
0,5693,I'm reading an interesting report on Mars .,Y
1,5693,"Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ?",Y
2,5693,Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is .,Y
3,5693,Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ?,Y
4,5693,The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation .,Y
5,5693,"Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ?",Y
6,5693,"I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs .",Y
7,5693,One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ?,Y
8,5693,"Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago .",Y
9,5693,But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans .,Y
10,5693,"I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know .",N
11,5693,I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there .,Y
12,5693,"But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . __eou__",Y
0,5694,Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ?,N
1,5694,"I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out .",N
2,5694,What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ?,N
3,5694,"Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st .",N
4,5694,That's fine . I want 2 tickets . __eou__,N
0,5695,"Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . .",Y
1,5695,You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible .,Y
2,5695,But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ?,Y
3,5695,It's once in blue moon .,N
4,5695,What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ?,Y
5,5695,"The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . __eou__",Y
0,5696,I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert .,N
1,5696,Sure . How do you like your seats ?,N
2,5696,"Ordinary one , please .",N
3,5696,"Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 .",N
4,5696,I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 .,N
5,5696,That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 . __eou__,N
0,5697,Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ?,Y
1,5697,"No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough .",Y
2,5697,"But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ?",Y
3,5697,"Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other .",Y
4,5697,"Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot .",N
5,5697,You're welcome . __eou__,N
0,5698,Do you have anything to do after this ?,N
1,5698,"No , I don't .",N
2,5698,Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?,Y
3,5698,That sounds like a good idea .,Y
4,5698,I know a very interesting place .,Y
5,5698,"Oh , do you ? Good . __eou__",N
0,5699,"Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' !",Y
1,5699,What's Net Love ?,Y
2,5699,Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love .,Y
3,5699,Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex !,N
4,5699,Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ?,Y
5,5699,How could you know ?,Y
6,5699,I watched the screen display !,N
7,5699,Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca !,N
8,5699,"It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA !",N
9,5699,Impossible ! __eou__,N
0,5700,I hear you are moving to Dalian .,N
1,5700,Yes . I found a very good job down here .,N
2,5700,"Well , we'll certainly miss you here .",N
3,5700,"I am going to miss you , too .",N
4,5700,Let's keep in touch .,Y
5,5700,OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there . __eou__,N
0,5701,I just got a letter from an old high school buddy .,N
1,5701,Really ? That's nice .,N
2,5701,He usually keeps me posted .,N
3,5701,I've been completely out of touch with my old friends .,Y
4,5701,It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much .,Y
5,5701,"Yes , people just seem to drift apart . __eou__",Y
0,5702,Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you .,N
1,5702,I know that .,N
2,5702,"You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already .",Y
3,5702,"Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ...",Y
4,5702,& you ?,N
5,5702,"Look , I am playing the piano for you .",N
6,5702,"Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you .",N
7,5702,"Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later .",N
8,5702,OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you .,N
9,5702,Ha ! She is too little .,N
10,5702,"Cute , like you .",N
11,5702,I want to tell you that I like you,N
12,5702,Me too . Send you a kiss ...,N
13,5702,Thx . __eou__,N
0,5703,Do you have a bf ?,N
1,5703,"Yes , I had a bf before .",N
2,5703,Why you say bf before ?,N
3,5703,We parted from each other last month .,N
4,5703,Have you got a new one ?,N
5,5703,"Mmmm , no . How about you ?",N
6,5703,"I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you .",N
7,5703,"Haha , so you are my E-bf .",N
8,5703,I like you . Do you agree to be my of ?,N
9,5703,"Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be .",Y
10,5703,Wow ! Blablablabla . . .,N
11,5703,Hey ! What is it ?,N
12,5703,I am flying like a bird .,Y
13,5703,LL,N
14,5703,I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne .,N
15,5703,I have no champagne right now . How about this ?,Y
16,5703,"It's OK , so I send you this .",N
17,5703,Is it made of chocolate ?,N
18,5703,It's my heart ; it's made of what you like .,N
19,5703,"Oh , I will have a sweet dream .",N
20,5703,Are you sleepy ?,N
21,5703,A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to .,N

23,5703,Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss .,N
24,5703,"C U here , honey . __eou__",N
0,5704,"Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ?",Y
1,5704,"I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .",Y
2,5704,There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?,Y
3,5704,I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world .,Y
4,5704,Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ?,Y
5,5704,"I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .",Y
6,5704,"Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet",Y
7,5704,"Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched .",N
8,5704,Do you have any successful stories to share ?,Y
9,5704,"Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . __eou__",N
0,5705,How long have you been living in New York ?,N
1,5705,"Oh , about two years now .",N
2,5705,Where do your parents live ?,N
3,5705,They still live in Shanghai where I was born .,N
4,5705,Do you write or call them very much ?,N
5,5705,"Yes , I try to keep in touch with them . __eou__",N
0,5706,"Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick .",N
1,5706,"Wow , what a great burd !",N
2,5706,She sure knows how to strut her stuff .,N
3,5706,"She's a real turn-on , alright ?",N
4,5706,And look out she's dressed .,N
5,5706,"Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded .",N
6,5706,No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants .,N
7,5706,"Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful .",N
8,5706,I think you've lost it .,N
9,5706,"Well , that's my opinion .",N
10,5706,I admit that she is much prettier than Kate .,N
11,5706,"Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly .",N
12,5706,At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__,N

2,5707,Then let's go in .,Y
3,5707,"I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .",N
4,5707,I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .,N
5,5707,I know . I wonder what's keeping him .,Y
6,5707,"Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?",N
7,5707,"Yeah , a number of times .",N
8,5707,What's he trying to pull anyway .,N
9,5707,I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .,N
10,5707,Maybe you should start seeing someone else .,Y
11,5707,"You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . __eou__",Y
0,5708,Did you enjoy that new movie ?,N
1,5708,"That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon .",N

3,5708,"I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it .",N
4,5708,"What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming .",N
5,5708,"Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ?",N
6,5708,Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ?,N
7,5708,His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .,N
8,5708,I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me .,N
9,5708,I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .,N
10,5708,Doesn't sound promising .,N
11,5708,"Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug .",N
12,5708,If you want I'll let him know if I run into him .,Y
13,5708,"Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class . __eou__",N
0,5709,It is really exciting news .,Y
1,5709,What news ?,N
2,5709,You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones .,N
3,5709,You know what we will get ?,N
4,5709,"We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station .",Y
5,5709,What docking station ?,N
6,5709,"This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient .",Y
7,5709,"Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . __eou__",Y
0,5710,What are your plans for this weekend ?,N
1,5710,I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday .,Y

4,5710,I know a good place to hire bikes if you want .,Y
5,5710,Thanks . That would be really helpful .,N

0,5715,"I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right",N
1,5715,"I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs .",N
2,5715,Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ?,Y
3,5715,"In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter .",Y
4,5715,So many ?,N
5,5715,This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences .,Y

11,5725,"Yes , she's lived there for about ten years .",N
12,5725,I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then .,N

7,5747,"Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that .",N
8,5747,What a thrilling trip ! __eou__,Y
0,5748,"Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be .",N
1,5748,"True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles .",Y
2,5748,I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % .,Y
3,5748,"The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat .",Y
4,5748,But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . __eou__,Y
0,5749,Do you have brothers and sisters ?,N

2,5755,"Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while .",Y
3,5755,You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit .,Y
4,5755,"That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . __eou__",Y

3,5772,"You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .",Y
4,5772,What can you do when this happens ?,Y
5,5772,"Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . __eou__",N
0,5773,Hi . are you new here ?,N
1,5773,Yes . I moved here last week .,N
2,5773,"I'm Steven , your neighbour .",N
3,5773,I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you .,N
4,5773,"Nice to meet you , too .",N
5,5773,"Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on .",Y
6,5773,"I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then .",N
7,5773,Thank you . I will . __eou__,N
0,5774,Please come in !,N
1,5774,Hi . Steven . I just drop in and want to have a chat with you .,N
2,5774,"Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home .",N
3,5774,OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful .,N
4,5774,Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this .,N
5,5774,She must have done a lot of work on it .,N
6,5774,You bet . __eou__,Y
0,5775,What a wonderful game !,N
1,5775,"Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful .",N
2,5775,I think John is the best player on the field .,N
3,5775,He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage .,N
4,5775,"Maybe he shouldn ’ t come to collage , he should become a football star . __eou__",Y
0,5776,Do you have a park in the city ?,N
1,5776,"Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful .",Y
2,5776,That ’ s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon .,N
3,5776,It ’ s a good idea . But I am afraid it ’ s too cold . It is very windy on the lake .,N
4,5776,Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park . __eou__,Y
0,5777,"Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning .",N
1,5777,I know them . They are the two brothers living next door .,N
2,5777,Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ?,N
3,5777,It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers .,N
4,5777,Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ?,N
5,5777,"No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . __eou__",N
0,5778,"Hi , Mrs . Henderson .",N
1,5778,"Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ?",N
2,5778,Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ?,N
3,5778,The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ?,N
4,5778,No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ?,N
5,5778,I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary .,N
6,5778,"Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip .",N
7,5778,OK . I close my mouth . __eou__,N
0,5779,"Tom , I married Julia last month . Have you already known it ?",N
1,5779,"No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news .",N
2,5779,"Indeed , we got married too soon .",N
3,5779,Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ?,N
4,5779,"Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time .",N
5,5779,How's your married life ?,N
6,5779,We're happy together now .,N
7,5779,I have to say you're a well-matched couple .,N
8,5779,Thank you ! __eou__,N
0,5780,"I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it .",N
1,5780,How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ?,N
2,5780,"It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters .",N
3,5780,That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ?,N
4,5780,"Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once .",Y
5,5780,"If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__",Y
0,5781,"Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .",Y
1,5781,Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .,Y
2,5781,Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .,N
3,5781,Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .,N
4,5781,You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?,Y
5,5781,They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .,N
6,5781,"Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?",N
7,5781,"Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .",Y
8,5781,Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?,N
9,5781,It's possible . __eou__,Y
0,5782,Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon .,N
1,5782,Thank you . I am very excited .,N
2,5782,We are all very proud of you .,N
3,5782,"I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won .",N
4,5782,I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement .,N
5,5782,It was really an exciting moment . __eou__,Y
0,5783,I like to stay here .,N
1,5783,Why ?,N
2,5783,People are very kind down your way . You ’ re lucky .,N
3,5783,"Yes , do you always gather to welcome new comers ?",N
4,5783,Never .,N
5,5783,Really ?,N
6,5783,Yeah . People down our way hardly speak to each other . __eou__,N
0,5784,Just make yourself at home .,N
1,5784,Thank you . You are cooking up a storm .,N
2,5784,Wouldn't you like some more chicken ?,N
3,5784,"No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . __eou__",N
0,5785,You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish .,N
1,5785,"No , thanks . I have had enough .",N
2,5785,What about some drink ?,Y
3,5785,Please bring me a cup of coffee . __eou__,N
0,5786,The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all .,N
1,5786,Maybe you can't be so sure .,Y
2,5786,Why not ? The whole idea is superstitious .,N
3,5786,But some people use this occasion to create trouble . Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer ? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth .,Y
4,5786,I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people . __eou__,N
0,5787,Where did you go yesterday ?,N
1,5787,I went to Croydon .,N
2,5787,Did you go shopping ?,N
3,5787,"No , I went for an interview .",N
4,5787,"Oh , did you get a job ?",N
5,5787,"Yes , I got a job as a Management Trainee .",N
6,5787,Fantastic . __eou__,N
0,5788,"Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .",N
1,5788,"Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too .",N
2,5788,I guess we'll see each other around .,N
3,5788,"Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy .",N
4,5788,You too . __eou__,N
0,5789,"Excuse me , is this seat taken ?",N
1,5789,"Er ... no , go ahead .",N
2,5789,"You work upstair , right ? I think I have seen you before . I'm Karren , Karren Brown .",N
3,5789,"Nice to meet you , Karren . I'm Tim Wang .",N
4,5789,"Happy to know you , Tim . __eou__",N
0,5790,I visited the Polar Aquarium today .,N
1,5790,Is it like a zoo of polar animals ?,Y
2,5790,"Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them .",Y
3,5790,It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds .,Y
4,5790,"Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days .",Y
5,5790,Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . __eou__,Y
0,5791,When do children start school in your country ?,N
1,5791,"Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center .",Y
2,5791,"But thats only in the cities , isnt it ?",N
3,5791,"Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated .",N
4,5791,Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ?,Y
5,5791,"It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . __eou__",Y
0,5792,Let me see . How much should I pay for you ?,N
1,5792,Don ’ t think about it !,N
2,5792,"No , this will not do . Let me see .",N
3,5792,"You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up .",Y
4,5792,Good ideas . __eou__,Y
0,5793,"Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ?",N
1,5793,I wouldn't say so .,N
2,5793,What do you mean ?,N
3,5793,"Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . __eou__",N
0,5794,I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt .,N
1,5794,"So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ?",Y
2,5794,How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . __eou__,N
0,5795,"Look , there are some words on the fish .",N
1,5795,I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays .,Y
2,5795,For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ?,N
3,5795,Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic .,N
4,5795,You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people .,N
5,5795,"Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal .",N
6,5795,"Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ?",Y
7,5795,"OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? __eou__",Y
0,5796,"John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ?",Y
1,5796,Sure . Have you checked the weather report ?,N
2,5796,Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all .,N
3,5796,I'd like some toast and chicken wings .,N
4,5796,Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me .,N
5,5796,"Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket .",N
6,5796,"That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it .",Y
7,5796,"Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket .",Y
8,5796,"Okay , it sounds good . __eou__",N
0,5797,"May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?",N
1,5797,"Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !",Y
2,5797,Why are they all in glass boxes ?,Y
3,5797,For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .,Y
4,5797,So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?,N
5,5797,"No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box .",N
6,5797,I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ?,Y
7,5797,"Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .",Y
8,5797,"Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV .",Y
9,5797,"It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! __eou__",N
0,5798,I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up .,N
1,5798,"Be careful of what you say , or you ’ ll have to eat humble pie .",N
2,5798,"Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ’ Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him . __eou__",N
0,5799,"Hi , Sue . What's up ?",N
1,5799,"Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ?",N
2,5799,"Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently .",N
3,5799,Really ? What's he been doing ?,N
4,5799,"You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now .",N
5,5799,Are you ? What are you busy with ?,N
6,5799,"Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . __eou__",Y
0,5800,My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ?,N
1,5800,"He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ?",N
2,5800,"He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office .",Y
3,5800,It must be hard being a father .,N
4,5800,"No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you .",Y
5,5800,Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day . __eou__,Y
0,5801,The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ?,Y
1,5801,"Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image .",Y
2,5801,"That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent .",Y
3,5801,I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president .,N
4,5801,But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . __eou__,N
0,5802,"Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ?",Y
1,5802,"Sure , what's up ?",N
2,5802,I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ?,N
3,5802,Good question . I have to think about it .,N
4,5802,My husband is betting on France .,N
5,5802,France ? Is he crazy ?,N
6,5802,What do you mean ?,N
7,5802,"Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . __eou__",N
0,5803,I think Andy's party will be fun .,N
1,5803,"Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something .",N
2,5803,What's that ?,N
3,5803,Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ?,N
4,5803,"Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ?",N
5,5803,"My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . __eou__",N
0,5804,"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .",N
1,5804,Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?,N
2,5804,Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .,Y
3,5804,Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?,Y
4,5804,"I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .",N
5,5804,You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . __eou__,Y
0,5805,Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here .,N
1,5805,"Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze .",N
2,5805,"All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ?",Y
3,5805,"Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . __eou__",Y
0,5806,"Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?",N
1,5806,"I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .",N
2,5806,Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?,N
3,5806,"I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . __eou__",Y
0,5807,"Happy Birthday , Mary !",N
1,5807,Thank you .,N
2,5807,Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it .,N
3,5807,What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ?,N
4,5807,I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt .,N
5,5807,"Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother .",N
6,5807,Really ? It looks so nice .,N
7,5807,Thank you . Please have a cup of tea .,N
8,5807,All right .,N
9,5807,How about some fish ?,Y
10,5807,"No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake .",N
11,5807,"OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ?",N
12,5807,"No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary .",Y
13,5807,It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . __eou__,N
0,5808,Cheer !,N
1,5808,Cheer !,N
2,5808,So what time tomorrow ?,N
3,5808,Half past seven in the morning .,N

5,5808,In the market .,Y
6,5808,OK . Bottoms up .,N
7,5808,Bottoms up .,N
8,5808,It's on me .,N
9,5808,Thank you . This place is nice . __eou__,N
0,5809,"Adam , I'm sorry !",N
1,5809,"But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late .",N
2,5809,"Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another .",N
3,5809,"But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ?",N
4,5809,"Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters .",N
5,5809,But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ?,N
6,5809,"Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry .",N
7,5809,"Well , you're here . And that's the main thing . __eou__",N
0,5810,"Could you tell me the right time , please ?",N
1,5810,"Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days .",N
2,5810,You'll have to get it fixed .,N
3,5810,"Yes , I will . __eou__",N
0,5811,"What is the correct time , please ?",N
1,5811,It's exactly twelve minutes past seven .,N
2,5811,When will the lecture begin ?,N
3,5811,It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . __eou__,N
0,5812,"Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six .",N
1,5812,"In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time .",N
2,5812,Ok . Goodbye .,N
3,5812,See you later . __eou__,N
0,5813,I just dropped in to say goodbye .,N
1,5813,What time are you leaving ?,N
2,5813,I'll leave at 10 o'clock .,N
3,5813,Take care and give my best to you parents .,N
4,5813,"Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__",N
0,5814,Are you free tomorrow night ?,N
1,5814,"Yes , I am .",N
2,5814,Shall we have dinner together ?,N
3,5814,Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?,N
4,5814,"Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .",N
5,5814,OK . I'll be happy to join you . __eou__,N
0,5815,"What time is it , Tom ?",N
1,5815,Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch .,N
2,5815,Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now .,N
3,5815,What's the hurry ?,N
4,5815,I must catch the nine-thirty train .,N
5,5815,You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there . __eou__,Y
0,5816,"Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last .",N
1,5816,"Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling .",N
2,5816,Are you OK today ?,N
3,5816,Quite good except thinking of you so much .,N
4,5816,So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind .,N
5,5816,"It's called love is blind , I think . __eou__",Y
0,5817,Thank you for coming to see me off .,N
1,5817,Not at all .,N
2,5817,"If have time , I'll come again .",N
3,5817,You're welcome at any time .,N
4,5817,Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay .,N
5,5817,You're most welcome .,N
6,5817,I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon .,N
7,5817,Call us as soon as you get home . __eou__,N
0,5818,"Did you watch TV last night , Rose ?",N
1,5818,Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting .,N
2,5818,What was it about ?,N
3,5818,Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it .,Y
4,5818,"If so , we may live there someday .",Y
5,5818,I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ?,N
6,5818,"Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists .",N
7,5818,Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . __eou__,N
0,5819,Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective .,Y
1,5819,"That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ?",Y
2,5819,Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective .,Y
3,5819,"Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not .",Y
4,5819,The internet's a lot worse .,N
5,5819,Really ? Why ?,N
6,5819,"There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online .",Y
7,5819,"Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . __eou__",N
0,5820,Who is your favorite NBA star ?,N
1,5820,"Kobe Bryant , of course .",N
2,5820,"Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense .",N
3,5820,"He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand .",Y
4,5820,Maybe he is not good at rebounding ?,Y
5,5820,"Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit .",Y
6,5820,Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ?,N
7,5820,Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him .,N
8,5820,"Well then , what are your spoils ?",N
9,5820,"Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . __eou__",N
0,5821,"Hmm , what should I wear today ?",N
1,5821,"Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe .",N
2,5821,"Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ?",Y
3,5821,I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you .,N
4,5821,"Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today .",N
5,5821,No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic .,N
6,5821,"Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size .",Y
7,5821,OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . __eou__,N
0,5822,How do you like this waltz ?,N
1,5822,It's very nice . I like it very much .,N
2,5822,"Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ?",Y
3,5822,"My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often .",N
4,5822,"Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I only took up dancing quite recently .",N
5,5822,"Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .",N
6,5822,I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner .,N
7,5822,Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ?,N
8,5822,Yes . And what dances do you like best ?,N
9,5822,"Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing .",Y
10,5822,"Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .",N
11,5822,My pleasure . __eou__,N
0,5823,"I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida .",Y
1,5823,That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there .,Y
2,5823,"But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin .",Y
3,5823,You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer .,N
4,5823,I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good .,N
5,5823,You said it . __eou__,N
0,5824,Would you like a cigarette ?,N
1,5824,"No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .",N
2,5824,Really ? Why ?,N
3,5824,"Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .",Y
4,5824,I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?,N
5,5824,"That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health .",N
6,5824,Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .,N
7,5824,"But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !",N
8,5824,What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?,N
9,5824,I mean you couldn't give it up !,N
10,5824,Who ? Me ? Could't give up smoking ? Nonsense ! Of course I could ! I know I could !,Y
11,5824,How do you know ?,N
12,5824,Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times ! __eou__,N
0,5825,"You went out on a date last night , didn't you ?",N
1,5825,"Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time .",N
2,5825,How come ?,N
3,5825,I don't know .,N
4,5825,Why don't you phone her for a date again ?,Y
5,5825,"I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me .",N
6,5825,"Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again .",Y
7,5825,I will . Thanks for your advice . __eou__,N
0,5826,What are you using for bait today ?,N
1,5826,We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them .,N

3,5826,Looks like a lucky day for everyone . __eou__,N
0,5827,Mary and Tom are breaking up .,N
1,5827,It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?,N
2,5827,"Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .",N
3,5827,Do you think they'll become reconciled ?,N
4,5827,"No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .",N
5,5827,What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . __eou__,N
0,5828,Do you know who Ammo Hung is ?,N
1,5828,"Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director .",Y
2,5828,You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ?,Y
3,5828,I have no idea . Tell me .,Y
4,5828,"In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show .",Y
5,5828,What does he do there ?,N
6,5828,"Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . __eou__",Y
0,5829,Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ?,N
1,5829,Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long .,N
2,5829,"Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .",N
3,5829,OK . Then tell me what else you know .,N
4,5829,Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ?,Y
5,5829,"He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ?",Y
6,5829,"Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '",Y
7,5829,Indeed you know much about him .,N
8,5829,This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world . __eou__,Y
0,5830,"Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood .",N
1,5830,Hackneyed theme !,N
2,5830,What ? How much do you know Hollywood ?,N
3,5830,Nearly everything .,N
4,5830,You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ?,N
5,5830,"Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often .",Y
6,5830,Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s,N
7,5830,Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it .,Y
8,5830,Mm . What came after that ?,N
9,5830,"After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals .",Y
10,5830,Pretty good . Please continue .,N
11,5830,"Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . .",Y
12,5830,"The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers .",Y
13,5830,Come on .,N
14,5830,"Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have .",Y
15,5830,Any more ?,N
16,5830,"Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . __eou__",Y
0,5831,"Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light .",Y
1,5831,Yeah .,N
2,5831,Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed .,Y
3,5831,"Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person .",Y
4,5831,It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties .,Y
5,5831,I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen .,Y
6,5831,Then fans don't see you much in public places .,N
7,5831,"Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place .",Y
8,5831,"A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . '",Y
9,5831,"I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . __eou__",Y
0,5832,It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him .,N
1,5832,We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me .,N
2,5832,He must be all over you the first time he saw you .,N
3,5832,He said that I put all other girls in the shade .,N
4,5832,That means he was head over heels in love with you .,N
5,5832,"Well , he indeed likes me .",N
6,5832,But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question .,N
7,5832,"No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . __eou__",Y
0,5833,How did you first meet Jack each other ?,Y
1,5833,That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark .,N
2,5833,And then ?,N
3,5833,"I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? '",N
4,5833,Then he sent you to your home ?,N
5,5833,Yeah .,N
6,5833,It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty .,Y
7,5833,He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant .,N
8,5833,He is so humorous . __eou__,N
0,5834,Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ?,N
1,5834,"I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .",Y
2,5834,"Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . __eou__",N
0,5835,"I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion .",Y
1,5835,A magic love potion ?,Y
2,5835,"Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up .",Y
3,5835,It can't be true .,N
4,5835,Take my word for it .,N
5,5835,So what am I going to do ?,N
6,5835,"Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! '",Y
7,5835,That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ?,Y
8,5835,"Don't be so shy , Lucy . __eou__",N
0,5836,I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic .,N
1,5836,Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs .,N
2,5836,"Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard .",N
3,5836,I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers .,N
4,5836,"The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ?",Y
5,5836,Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now .,N
6,5836,Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ?,N
7,5836,Why not ? __eou__,Y
0,5837,"Herman , why are you so excited ?",N
1,5837,I have met a beautiful girl .,N
2,5837,Have you fallen in love ?,N
3,5837,Yes . At first sight .,N
4,5837,Can you describe the situation at that time ?,N
5,5837,"At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold .",Y
6,5837,What's her outlook ?,N
7,5837,"She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden . __eou__",Y
0,5838,Did you watch the Premiership last night ?,N
1,5838,"Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match .",N
2,5838,"No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it .",Y
3,5838,"Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye .",Y
4,5838,Which team do you back then ?,N
5,5838,"I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking .",Y
6,5838,But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . __eou__,Y
0,5839,"Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum .",N
1,5839,Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ?,N
2,5839,"I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting .",N
3,5839,I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum .,Y
4,5839,Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be .,N
5,5839,Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry .,N
6,5839,Good idea .,Y
7,5839,( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ?,N
8,5839,I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map,Y
9,5839,"Sure , take your time . We have a whole day .",Y
10,5839,It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece .,N
11,5839,Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . __eou__,Y
0,5840,Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ?,N
1,5840,I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions .,N
2,5840,"No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows .",N
3,5840,It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell .,Y
4,5840,"Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .",Y
5,5840,"I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes .",Y
6,5840,"That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals .",Y
7,5840,"Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . __eou__",Y
0,5841,What do you think of smoking ?,N
1,5841,It's harmful . Not only for yourself but for others .,N
2,5841,What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?,Y
3,5841,Stop producing cigarettes .,N
4,5841,But that'll affect the national economy .,N
5,5841,That's right.But I don't think there are better ways .,N
6,5841,How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?,Y
7,5841,Maybe it can take effect . __eou__,Y
0,5842,Are you a smoker ?,N
1,5842,"Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too .",N
2,5842,Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?,N
3,5842,"No , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day .",N
4,5842,When did you begin to smoke ?,N
5,5842,I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen .,N
6,5842,Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ?,N
7,5842,"Yes , twice . __eou__",N
0,5843,Then I must go-you have said it yourself .,N
1,5843,"No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept .",N
2,5843,I tell you I must go !,N
3,5843,Where ?,N
4,5843,"I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now .",N
5,5843,I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion .,N
6,5843,I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . __eou__,N
0,5844,Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air .,Y
1,5844,I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ?,Y
2,5844,why not ? I love animals and I love nature .,Y
3,5844,"You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun .",Y
4,5844,sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there .,N
5,5844,Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here .,Y
6,5844,"That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing .",Y
7,5844,I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm .,Y
8,5844,"Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try .",Y
9,5844,I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first .,Y
10,5844,Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ?,Y
11,5844,Of course . I will .,Y
12,5844,Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun .,Y
13,5844,"It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider .",N
14,5844,No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . __eou__,Y
0,5845,I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals .,Y
1,5845,A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people .,Y
2,5845,That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now .,Y
3,5845,Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people .,N
4,5845,"why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy .",Y
5,5845,Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty .,Y
6,5845,"They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors .",Y
7,5845,I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything .,Y
8,5845,Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people .,Y
9,5845,"To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not .",Y
10,5845,You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities .,N
11,5845,"That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home .",N
12,5845,You really can't live without candy . __eou__,N
0,5846,Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .,N
1,5846,I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .,N
2,5846,Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good .,Y
3,5846,No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . __eou__,Y

0,5848,May I ask what the name is the girl ?,N
1,5848,Which one ?,N

0,5849,You look a bit dull today . What's up ?,N
1,5849,"Well , my mum lost her job yesterday .",N
2,5849,"I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women .",N
3,5849,The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole .,Y
4,5849,"Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ?",N
5,5849,"Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community .",Y
6,5849,That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually .,Y

3,5851,"No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem .",Y
4,5851,"That's my business , not yours .",N
5,5851,"True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important .",Y
6,5851,So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ?,N
7,5851,"I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises .",Y
8,5851,I'm not disciplined enough I guess .,N
9,5851,In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . __eou__,Y
0,5852,"Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ?",N
1,5852,"I needed some money , so I hocked it last week .",N
2,5852,You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that .,N
3,5852,I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that .,N
4,5852,It sounds like you weren't expecting that .,N
5,5852,I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away .,N
6,5852,"Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some .",Y

8,5853,"Ah ... No , I can't place her . __eou__",N
0,5854,That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ?,N
1,5854,Of course . I always keep what I catch .,N
2,5854,Not me . I like to throw back what I catch .,N
3,5854,"If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it . __eou__",N
0,5855,My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay .,Y
1,5855,It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do .,Y
2,5855,But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ?,N
3,5855,It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment .,Y
4,5855,What time is the right moment ?,N
5,5855,Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . __eou__,Y
0,5856,"Hey , buddy . Are the fish biting today ?",N

6,5856,We're using worms .,Y
7,5856,Are you having any luck with the worms ?,N
8,5856,"No , we haven't even gotten a nibble today .",N
9,5856,That's too bad . Why don't you try using lures instead ?,Y
10,5856,"I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box .",N
11,5856,"That's too bad . Well , where are you fishing ?",N
12,5856,I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ?,N
13,5856,We went out in our boat . I have a favorite fishing hole out there .,N
14,5856,Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ?,N
15,5856,"Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ?",N
16,5856,Do you think that's a good spot ?,N
17,5856,"Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time .",N
18,5856,Thanks . I think I'll go check that out now .,N
19,5856,Good luck . I hope you each some fish . __eou__,N
0,5857,I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ?,N
1,5857,He appeals to the fans thanks to two things,Y
2,5857,"You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .",N
3,5857,"Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time .",Y
4,5857,"In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .",Y
5,5857,"Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout .",Y
6,5857,And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . __eou__,N
0,5858,Are you still busy today ?,N

0,5859,"Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information .",Y
1,5859,Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day .,Y
2,5859,"It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines .",N
3,5859,Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ?,Y
4,5859,"Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin .",Y
5,5859,I like to read Fortune .,N
6,5859,"Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too .",Y
7,5859,Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases .,Y
8,5859,"A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc .",Y
9,5859,"But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect .",Y

0,5861,"They are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us .",N
1,5861,"If they are just like us , they are not middle-aged .",N
2,5861,Of course they are .,N
3,5861,"Middle-aged means in the middle , Ethel , middle of life . People don't live to a hundred and fifty .",Y
4,5861,"Oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . That's all .",N
5,5861,"Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging .",N
6,5861,"Oh , fool ! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties . Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ?",N

3,5864,It depends . Sometimes I am very busy .,N
4,5864,What depends ?,N

2,5879,"Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards .",Y
3,5879,Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years,N

2,5880,Why do you like old styles of dance ?,N
3,5880,Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ?,Y

2,5881,"Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving .",N
3,5881,Then what are the Westerners fit for ?,N

5,5881,Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ?,Y
6,5881,"It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon .",N
7,5881,"I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . __eou__",Y

5,5883,What does it say ?,N
6,5883,"According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style .",Y
7,5883,Like disco ?,N
8,5883,"Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance .",Y
9,5883,And disco a kind of nightclub .,Y
10,5883,"Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ...",N
11,5883,So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether .,Y

4,5884,"Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently .",N
5,5884,"Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well .",N
6,5884,"I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner .",N
7,5884,Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ?,N
8,5884,Yes . And what dances do you do best ?,N
9,5884,"Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance .",Y
10,5884,"Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance .",N
11,5884,My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink .,N
12,5884,Fine . __eou__,N
0,5885,What's your favorite sport ?,N
1,5885,"It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week .",Y
2,5885,Is the entrance charge expensive ?,N
3,5885,"Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute .",Y
4,5885,"Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ?",N
5,5885,"You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two .",Y
6,5885,You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . __eou__,N
0,5886,"It's rather cold , isn't it ?",N
1,5886,"Oh , yes , it is .",N

4,5886,"Well , what's the climate like in your country ?",Y
5,5886,"It's mild , but it's not always pleasant .",N
6,5886,Which season do you like best ?,N
7,5886,I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics . __eou__,Y
0,5887,How nice it is here .,N
1,5887,You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely .,N
2,5887,"I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year .",Y
3,5887,That's correct . We have four seasons of spring . __eou__,N
0,5888,The weather in Beijing is just beautiful !,N
1,5888,"Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know .",Y
2,5888,"Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away .",Y
3,5888,What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ?,N
4,5888,Autumn is also very nice in Washington .,Y
5,5888,Is it very cold in winter there ?,N
6,5888,"No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter .",N
7,5888,Does it rain a lot in summer there ?,N
8,5888,Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ?,N
9,5888,"There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn .",N
10,5888,I feel it's rather dry here .,N
11,5888,That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here .,N
12,5888,Are you from the south ?,N
13,5888,"No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually .",N
14,5888,I see.so this is your hometown ? __eou__,N
0,5889,I really like the record you lent me the other day .,N
1,5889,I'm glad you like it .,N
2,5889,And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .,N
3,5889,Not at all .,N
4,5889,I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it .,N
5,5889,I'm glad .,N
6,5889,Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? __eou__,N
0,5890,I'd better be going .,N
1,5890,So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ?,Y
2,5890,"I wish I could , but it's already late .",N
3,5890,"Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave .",N
4,5890,Thank you for a wonderful meal .,N
5,5890,I'm glad you enjoyed it . __eou__,N
0,5891,If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes .,Y
1,5891,Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China .,Y
2,5891,"Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it .",Y
3,5891,"Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms .",Y
4,5891,"Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . __eou__",Y
0,5892,How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ?,Y
1,5892,I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday .,N
2,5892,"How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning .",Y
3,5892,I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well .,N
4,5892,"Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most .",Y
5,5892,OK . I'll talk to you later . __eou__,N
0,5893,I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five .,N
1,5893,"Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ?",N
2,5893,No problem .,N
3,5893,Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then .,N
4,5893,I will . __eou__,N
0,5894,It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck .,N
1,5894,Thank you .,N
2,5894,I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye .,N
3,5894,"Yes , goodbye and keep in touch . __eou__",N

3,5895,"Yes , very good .",N
4,5895,What advantages does it have ?,N
5,5895,It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time .,Y
6,5895,"Yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time .",N
7,5895,"Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap .",Y
8,5895,"Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ?",N
9,5895,"To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways .",Y
10,5895,You mean there may be credit problems ?,N
11,5895,"Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided .",Y
12,5895,Will you give some suggestion ?,Y
13,5895,"Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website .",N
14,5895,Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future . __eou__,Y
0,5896,How do you shoot pool ?,N
1,5896,"You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball .",N
2,5896,And ?,N
3,5896,You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets .,Y
4,5896,How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ?,N
5,5896,"At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set .",Y
6,5896,Can I get the black ball in ?,N
7,5896,The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets .,N
8,5896,Let's go and try now ! __eou__,Y

3,5897,Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .,Y
4,5897,Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?,Y
5,5897,"That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .",Y
6,5897,Is the service charged ?,N
7,5897,No . it's free .,N
8,5897,Really . I'll get a computer at once . __eou__,Y
0,5898,"Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight .",Y
1,5898,That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread !,N
2,5898,That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . __eou__,N
0,5899,Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world .,Y
1,5899,"Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web .",Y
2,5899,One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores .,Y
3,5899,Can you tell me how it is done ?,N
4,5899,"If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge .",Y
5,5899,I see . So great . __eou__,N
0,5900,I'm better now . Want to play again ?,N

1,5901,All my relatives are getting together at my house .,N
2,5901,That's great . M OST of my family is coming home too .,N
3,5901,Who can't make it in your family ?,N
4,5901,My sister.She is going to her in-law's house this year .,N
5,5901,"That's too bad . So , what did you ask for Christmas this year ?",N
6,5901,I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games .,N
7,5901,I want some computer games also . I gave my parents a really long Christmas list .,N
8,5901,I hope that I get what I asked for .,N
9,5901,So what does your family do on Christmas Day ?,N

0,5905,"These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life .",Y
1,5905,Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions .,Y
2,5905,That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards .,N
3,5905,I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__,Y
0,5906,"Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ?",N
1,5906,I didn't sleep much last night .,N
2,5906,How come ?,N

6,5906,"Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them .",Y
7,5906,Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ?,N
8,5906,I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .,Y
9,5906,Yes . __eou__,N
0,5907,Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .,N
1,5907,"Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you .",N

9,5911,Why not ? __eou__,Y
0,5912,"I need your help , Bob .",N
1,5912,What's the matter ?,N
2,5912,I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations .,N
3,5912,Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look .,N
4,5912,"A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ?",N
5,5912,"ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? '",Y
6,5912,Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ?,N
7,5912,"Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act .",Y
8,5912,"Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong .",N
9,5912,Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' .,Y
10,5912,"Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning .",N
11,5912,"Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . __eou__",N

4,5913,"Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__",N
0,5914,what are you doing ?,N
1,5914,"I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper .",N
2,5914,"you really like brains that make you think , don't you ?",Y
3,5914,I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ?,Y
4,5914,I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at !,N
5,5914,Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ?,N
6,5914,"Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours .",N

14,5914,How about mah-jong ?,Y
15,5914,"It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it .",N
16,5914,I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong !,N
17,5914,"I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! __eou__",Y
0,5915,What did you do last night ?,N
1,5915,I just stayed at home and watched TV .,N
2,5915,Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?,N
3,5915,"Yes , it was a very evenly matched game .",N
4,5915,What were the results of the game ?,N
5,5915,It ended in a tie .,N
6,5915,What was the actual score ?,N
7,5915,It was three all .,N
8,5915,Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .,N
9,5915,"If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .",N
10,5915,What happened ?,N
11,5915,"Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .",N
12,5915,That explains it .,N
13,5915,How many more games are left this season ?,N

0,5916,Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?,N
1,5916,"No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .",N
2,5916,"Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .",N
3,5916,They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .,N
4,5916,They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want .,N
5,5916,I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .,N
6,5916,Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?,N
7,5916,"I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .",N
8,5916,"Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?",N
9,5916,"Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .",N
10,5916,I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .,N
11,5916,People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .,N
12,5916,I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .,N
13,5916,That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .,N
14,5916,Thank goodness we're not rich and famous !,N
15,5916,"Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . __eou__",Y
0,5917,What happened ? Why didn't he win ?,N
1,5917,Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .,N
2,5917,How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !,N
3,5917,"If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .",Y
4,5917,What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?,N
5,5917,He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .,N
6,5917,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .,Y
7,5917,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .,Y
8,5917,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .,N
9,5917,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !",Y
10,5917,"Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .",N
11,5917,"I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .",N
12,5917,Let's hope so . __eou__,N
0,5918,Guess what ! I know something you don't know !,N
1,5918,What's that ?,N
2,5918,How many planets are there in the solar system ?,N
3,5918,That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine .,N
4,5918,Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore !,N
5,5918,"Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know .",N
6,5918,"I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore .",Y
7,5918,That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that .,N
8,5918,"Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .",Y
9,5918,"I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around .",Y
10,5918,We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos .,Y
11,5918,Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ?,Y
12,5918,I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way .,Y
13,5918,Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ?,Y
14,5918,I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth .,N
15,5918,You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country !,Y
16,5918,"Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . __eou__",Y
0,5919,What date is it today ?,N
1,5919,"Today is December 23,2002 .",N
2,5919,"Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas .",N
3,5919,Merry Christmas to you ! __eou__,N
0,5920,Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ?,Y
1,5920,I don't think so .,N
2,5920,How about going to a concert ?,Y
3,5920,That suits me fine . __eou__,N
0,5921,"Hi , long time no see . How have you been ?",N
1,5921,"Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son .",N
2,5921,Tell me all about it .,Y
3,5921,"Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd .",N
4,5921,"Oh , I see . What makes you think that ?",N
5,5921,"Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew .",N
6,5921,Really ? What happened ?,N
7,5921,He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home .,N
8,5921,I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ?,N
9,5921,I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through .,N
10,5921,"You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life .",Y
11,5921,"You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to .",N
12,5921,"I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . __eou__",N
0,5922,"Hey , what's up ?",N
1,5922,"Oh , nothing .",N
2,5922,What were you writing ?,N
3,5922,( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk .,N
4,5922,You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken !,N
5,5922,I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person .,N
6,5922,"But , you work with her everyday .",N
7,5922,"That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red .",Y
8,5922,You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ?,Y
9,5922,"Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea .",Y
10,5922,"Well , I guess you don't want this note , then .",N
11,5922,What note ?,N
12,5922,I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night .,N
13,5922,You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything .,N
14,5922,"Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ?",N
15,5922,"Yeah , I want the note .",N
16,5922,Have a great time tomorrow night .,N
17,5922,Thanks . I plan on it . __eou__,N
0,5923,"Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ?",N
1,5923,"Speaking . Who's calling , please ?",N
2,5923,"Hi , Mary . This is Tom .",N
3,5923,"Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ?",N
4,5923,Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ?,N
5,5923,"Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free .",N
6,5923,"Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ?",Y
7,5923,Sounds like a good idea .,Y
8,5923,Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 .,N
9,5923,"Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . __eou__",N
0,5924,Does your girl friend like swimming ?,N
1,5924,"Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style .",N
2,5924,Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke .,N
3,5924,But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke,Y
4,5924,Really ? Then just ask her to follow me .,Y
5,5924,"I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ?",N
6,5924,Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing .,N
7,5924,"Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer .",N
8,5924,"To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun .",Y
9,5924,That's good . __eou__,N
0,5925,"So , are you enjoying the performance so far ?",N
1,5925,"Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ?",Y
2,5925,"I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though .",Y
3,5925,Do you know anyone in the play ?,N
4,5925,"Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine .",N
5,5925,Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ?,N
6,5925,That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great .,Y
7,5925,So you've seen other plays that he's directed ?,N
8,5925,"Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ?",Y
9,5925,"Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ?",Y
10,5925,"I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school .",Y
11,5925,What did you do ?,N
12,5925,I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ?,Y
13,5925,"I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much .",N
14,5925,Why not ?,Y
15,5925,I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat .,N
16,5925,"That sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . __eou__",N
0,5926,Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it .,Y
1,5926,"Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first .",Y
2,5926,What should I do then ?,N
3,5926,"I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour .",Y
4,5926,"I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?",Y
5,5926,"Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! __eou__",Y
0,5927,Could you come and spend the weekend with us ?,Y
1,5927,"Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already .",N
2,5927,That's too bad !,N
3,5927,Maybe some other time . __eou__,N
0,5928,"Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ?",N
1,5928,"Fine , just fine . Thanks .",N
2,5928,Doing anything for lunch ?,N
3,5928,"Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . __eou__",N
0,5929,Merry Christmas !,N
1,5929,The same to you !,N
2,5929,Are you doing anything special ?,N
3,5929,We're having some friends over.What are you doing ?,N
4,5929,Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . __eou__,N
0,5930,Have a nice weekend !,N
1,5930,Thanks.You too !,N
2,5930,Do you have any plans ?,N
3,5930,"Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ?",N
4,5930,"Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . __eou__",Y
0,5931,"Please excuse me , but I really have to be going .",N
1,5931,"Yes , of course . It was nice to see you .",N
2,5931,"It was nice to see you , too . And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . __eou__",N
0,5932,Bob !,N
1,5932,Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How've you been ?,N
2,5932,"Fine , just fine . And you ?",N
3,5932,Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ?,N
4,5932,Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . __eou__,N
0,5933,T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ?,N
1,5933,"Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation . __eou__",N
0,5934,Do you like swimming ?,N
1,5934,"Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors .",Y
2,5934,"Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems .",Y
3,5934,"I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch .",Y
4,5934,Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ?,N
5,5934,"Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . __eou__",N
0,5935,How do you like these dishes ?,N
1,5935,"Fine , they are colorful and tasty .",N
2,5935,Did you enjoy your dinner ?,N
3,5935,"Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this .",N
4,5935,Would you like some more rice ?,N
5,5935,"No , thanks . I'm full .",N
6,5935,Another piece of meat pie ?,N
7,5935,"No , thanks . I'm on diet .",N
8,5935,How about the dessert ?,Y
9,5935,"Ice cream , please . __eou__",N
0,5936,Congratulations on the new house !,N
1,5936,Thanks ! We love it .,N
2,5936,"Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful .",N
3,5936,I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it ! __eou__,N
0,5937,What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ?,N
1,5937,Probably nothing .,N
2,5937,You have to do something romantic .,Y
3,5937,Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means .,Y
4,5937,"Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time !",N
5,5937,"Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . __eou__",N
0,5938,What are you doing this Saturday ?,N
1,5938,Not much .,N
2,5938,Do you want to go see a movie ?,N
3,5938,That sounds good .,N
4,5938,What's playing at the Century Fox ?,N
5,5938,Candlelight in the Window,Y
6,5938,Should we go see it ?,N
7,5938,I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies .,N
8,5938,How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’,Y
9,5938,No . I heard that's really boring .,N
10,5938,Why don't we go to a concert instead ?,Y
11,5938,Great idea ! __eou__,Y
0,5939,"Another glass of beer , will you ?",N
1,5939,"Thanks , I'm enough .",N
2,5939,At least one for your trip .,Y
3,5939,I'll have it if you insist . __eou__,N
0,5940,"Happy Mother's Day , Mom !",N
1,5940,Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have !,N
2,5940,Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us .,Y
3,5940,"I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . __eou__",N
0,5941,Have you gone bowling before ?,N
1,5941,No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well .,N
2,5941,There are 10 frames in a bowling game . Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame .,N
3,5941,You just said 10 rounds .,N
4,5941,' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms .,Y
5,5941,Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this .,Y
6,5941,"Hey , slow down . I'll tell you more while playing . __eou__",Y
0,5942,You keep bowling spares but no strike .,N
1,5942,"I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball .",N
2,5942,"I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands .",N
3,5942,Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ?,N
4,5942,"The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares .",Y
5,5942,Really ? I will try again . __eou__,N
0,5943,Are your ready to go to the supermarket ?,N
1,5943,"Yes , are you ?",N
2,5943,"I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready .",N
3,5943,"You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you .",N
4,5943,It wasn't cold out this morning .,N
5,5943,"Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there !",N
6,5943,Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ?,N
7,5943,"It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .",Y
8,5943,That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it .,Y
9,5943,Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here .,N
10,5943,How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?,N
11,5943,I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night .,N
12,5943,Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse .,Y
13,5943,I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?,N
14,5943,Good idea . That will help us to warm up .,Y
15,5943,"If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me .",N
16,5943,Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . __eou__,N
0,5944,"I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks .",Y
1,5944,"Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that .",Y
2,5944,"Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .",N
3,5944,Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well .,N
4,5944,"Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .",N
5,5944,I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets . __eou__,N
0,5945,May I know how old you are ?,N
1,5945,I am 24 .,N
2,5945,What is your date of birth ?,N
3,5945,"I was born on April 15 , 1986 . __eou__",N
0,5946,When and where were you born ?,N
1,5946,I was born in Beijing in 1965 .,N
2,5946,You look so young .,N
3,5946,Really ? Thank you . __eou__,N
0,5947,"Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf .",N
1,5947,You're really sporty !,N
2,5947,I want to do everything I can .,Y
3,5947,Do you have clubs ?,N
4,5947,No . Can I rent clubs ?,N
5,5947,There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times .,Y
6,5947,What kinds of clubs ?,Y
7,5947,Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 .,N
8,5947,I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me .,N
9,5947,Okay . __eou__,N
0,5948,This little wooden stick is called a tee .,Y
1,5948,What do you do with it ?,N
2,5948,"For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground .",Y
3,5948,Okay .,N
4,5948,"Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers .",N
5,5948,OK .,N
6,5948,"Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can .",Y
7,5948,Hey !,N
8,5948,Not too bad . The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible .,N
9,5948,Got it . __eou__,N
0,5949,Where is your native place ?,N
1,5949,"My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city .",N
2,5949,So are you a local ?,N
3,5949,"Yes , I am a local resident . __eou__",N
0,5950,"I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert .",N
1,5950,How about going to the theatre ?,Y
2,5950,I don't like going to the theatre .,N
3,5950,"Well , what do you like doing ?",Y
4,5950,"Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ?",Y
5,5950,"I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you .",Y
6,5950,"I like talking to you , too .",N
7,5950,Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow .,Y
8,5950,That's a good idea . __eou__,N
0,5951,Where did you go yesterday ?,N
1,5951,I went to play tennis in the public park .,N
2,5951,How often do you play tennis ?,N
3,5951,Twice a week . How about you ?,Y
4,5951,I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball .,N
5,5951,But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together .,N
6,5951,I usually play with my schoolmates .,N
7,5951,Do you like watching football matches ?,N
8,5951,"Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday . __eou__",N
0,5952,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?,N
1,5952,Yeah .,N
2,5952,Who won ?,N
3,5952,China .,N
4,5952,What was the score ?,N
5,5952,China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .,N
6,5952,Wonderful ! __eou__,Y
0,5953,Do you like traveling ?,N
1,5953,"Yes , I've just come back from Scotland .",N
2,5953,Where did you visit ?,N
3,5953,I only had time to visit Edinburgh .,N
4,5953,How did you like it ?,N
5,5953,It's fantastic .,N
6,5953,Why did you go there ?,N
7,5953,I went there on business .,N
8,5953,And do you have friends there ?,N
9,5953,"Yes , a lot of friends .",N
10,5953,You must have enjoyed yourself .,N
11,5953,"Yes , and I look many pictures . __eou__",Y
0,5954,"So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ?",N
1,5954,"Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected .",Y
2,5954,"And , is it what you found ?",N
3,5954,"Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city .",Y
4,5954,You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . __eou__,N
0,5955,I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ?,N
1,5955,"Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team .",N
2,5955,Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ?,N
3,5955,Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration .,N
4,5955,Could you move smoothly ?,Y
5,5955,Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind .,N
6,5955,What happened afterwards ?,N
7,5955,I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was .,Y
8,5955,Poor girl ! __eou__,N
0,5956,"How do you like skiing , Pat ?",N
1,5956,I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year .,N
2,5956,I suppose skiing is easy for you .,N
3,5956,"No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better .",Y
4,5956,I see . Do you ski often ?,N
5,5956,Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night .,N
6,5956,That sounds great .,N
7,5956,"Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ?",Y
8,5956,Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg,N
9,5956,Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . __eou__,Y
0,5957,"Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?",N
1,5957,"Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .",N
2,5957,Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ?,N
3,5957,"I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .",Y
4,5957,That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .,Y
5,5957,"Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .",N
6,5957,"Ok , good luck to you . __eou__",N
0,5958,It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy .,N
1,5958,"I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him .",Y
2,5958,How come you think of him that way ?,N
3,5958,Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out .,N
4,5958,I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm .,N

0,5963,How do you think should I handle this problem ?,Y
1,5963,You'd just let sleeping dogs lie .,N
2,5963,But I'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss .,N
3,5963,Anything you say or do might make it worse . Just try to ride out the storm for a while .,N
4,5963,She's always bothering me . What should I do ?,N
5,5963,You'd better leave her alone .,N

0,5969,But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out .,N
1,5969,Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men .,N
2,5969,"I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too .",Y

8,5971,It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .,Y

3,5972,"Sure , they do .",N
4,5972,But why do you choose cycling at first ?,N
5,5972,Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection .,Y
6,5972,You are really a good citizen .,N
7,5972,That ’ s what I can do . __eou__,N

11,5977,"If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .",Y
12,5977,Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?,Y
13,5977,"Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .",Y

4,5979,"Well , about an hour or so .",N
5,5979,"Wow , that ’ s quite a long journey . Do you drive a car ?",N
6,5979,No . I take public transportation . It's safer .,N
7,5979,You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle .,Y
8,5979,"Well , both have advantages and disadvantages . __eou__",Y
0,5980,May I have a word with you ?,N

2,5982,I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?,N
3,5982,"Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .",N
4,5982,What's wrong with it ?,N
5,5982,"Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .",N
6,5982,When's the last time you had it serviced ?,N
7,5982,It must have been a few years ago now .,N
8,5982,I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .,N
9,5982,"They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !",Y
10,5982,What else is wrong with it ?,Y
11,5982,"The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !",N
12,5982,Anything else ?,N
13,5982,The brakes don't really work that well anymore either .,N
14,5982,Why don't you get it all fixed ?,Y

16,5982,"Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__",N
0,5983,You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ?,N

2,5985,Do you like him ?,N
3,5985,"Yes , I do like him .",N
4,5985,Then why are you hesitating ?,N
5,5985,"You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted .",N
6,5985,One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship .,Y
7,5985,Maybe you are right . __eou__,Y
0,5986,Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?,Y
1,5986,"Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then .",N
2,5986,"We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?",N
3,5986,"Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .",N

5,5986,"So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . __eou__",N
0,5987,"Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ?",N

0,5989,I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ?,Y
1,5989,"Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore .",Y
2,5989,Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ?,N
3,5989,"In some way , she is more modern .",Y
4,5989,"If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear .",N
5,5989,"If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely . __eou__",N
0,5990,"Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ?",N
1,5990,"Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me .",N
2,5990,"Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ?",N
3,5990,She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .,N
4,5990,Do you believe her excuse ?,N
5,5990,Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly .,N
6,5990,"Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love .",Y
7,5990,"Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend . __eou__",N
0,5991,Are you working or are you a student ?,N

2,5994,"Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .",Y
3,5994,"That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .",N
4,5994,I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .,N

4,6081,"We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced .",Y
5,6081,The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it .,Y
6,6081,I think you're right . An international response to this problem is needed . __eou__,Y

9,6082,Flares ?,Y
10,6082,They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers .,Y
11,6082,It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes .,N
12,6082,"That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . __eou__",Y
0,6083,How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ?,Y
1,6083,"Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time .",Y
2,6083,"Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it .",Y
3,6083,That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things .,Y
4,6083,You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something .,Y

1,6092,I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan .,N
2,6092,"It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun .",Y
3,6092,It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer . __eou__,N
0,6093,We'd like a half-day package .,N

1,6094,The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you .,Y
2,6094,Really ?,N
3,6094,But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body .,Y
4,6094,"Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! __eou__",Y

4,6095,Who has a crush ?,N
5,6095,"Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you .",Y
6,6095,I'd totally die if she turned me down .,N

4,6096,"That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song .",N
5,6096,I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ?,Y
6,6096,Always . __eou__,N

5,6097,Foxtrot . Oh . you're a good dancer .,N
6,6097,Really ? Thank you . I am thinking the same thing about you .,N
7,6097,I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely . __eou__,N
0,6098,"Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do .",Y
1,6098,What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ?,Y
2,6098,Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final .,N
3,6098,"Then , what shall we do on Sunday .",N
4,6098,Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time .,Y
5,6098,"Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off .",Y
6,6098,OK . __eou__,N
0,6099,"What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous !",N

2,6099,"From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ?",N
3,6099,Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband !,N
4,6099,"Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married .",N
5,6099,"He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon !",Y
6,6099,"She's chic , isn't she ?",N
7,6099,"Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed .",Y
8,6099,"It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say .",N
9,6099,Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her .,N
10,6099,Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate .,N
11,6099,I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry !,N
12,6099,"The gown is quite expensive , believe me .",N
13,6099,So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar .,N
14,6099,You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon .,N
15,6099,"You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure .",N
16,6099,Thanks . I'm flattered .,N

0,6100,"At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again !",N
1,6100,Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport .,N
2,6100,Do you know any secrets to China's success ?,N
3,6100,"In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions .",Y
4,6100,"So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership .",N
5,6100,"Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules .",N
6,6100,For example ?,N
7,6100,"They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other .",Y
8,6100,"Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights !",N
9,6100,"Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . __eou__",N
0,6101,"Hi , Bill . I saw you yesterday with a pretty girl .",N

6,6101,"Oh , that's great . You're serious this time . __eou__",N
0,6102,It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week .,Y

2,6102,Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy .,N
3,6102,Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky .,Y
4,6102,Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture .,N
5,6102,Yes . Will it hurt us ?,N
6,6102,I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map .,Y
7,6102,OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem .,N
8,6102,"I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know .",Y
9,6102,"You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree .",Y
10,6102,"Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think .",Y
11,6102,How do you know ?,N
12,6102,Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__,N

6,6103,"Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?",N
7,6103,At the mall on 5th street .,N
8,6103,Was it expensive ?,N
9,6103,"No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .",N
10,6103,That's cheap .,N
11,6103,I know . It was a really good deal .,N
12,6103,I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . __eou__,N

2,6107,I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man !,Y
3,6107,You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting .,Y
4,6107,"Are you serious , John ?",N
5,6107,All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . __eou__,Y

13,6117,Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .,Y
14,6117,That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . __eou__,N
0,6118,"How is your business on the Internet , Steven ?",Y
1,6118,Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy .,N

6,6157,That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?,Y
7,6157,"It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .",Y
8,6157,Got it . Are you still updating your blog ?,N
9,6157,"Sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .",Y

3,6159,"We did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work .",N
4,6159,"Can't you hang out with them , too ?",Y
5,6159,"I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out .",Y
6,6159,"Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you .",Y
7,6159,I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her .,N
8,6159,It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you .,N
9,6159,You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore .,N
10,6159,She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend .,Y
11,6159,I've given her enough time . I'm over it now .,N
12,6159,I still think you two should try to patch things up .,Y

4,6160,"Oh , yeah ? What's it about ?",N
5,6160,"Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving .",Y
6,6160,Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ?,N
7,6160,The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you .,N
8,6160,"Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend .",Y

1,6203,Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ?,N
2,6203,"No , he's living in an old house in Warton .",N
3,6203,Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ?,N
4,6203,That's the one .,N
5,6203,"His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ?",Y
6,6203,He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money .,N
7,6203,Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ?,N
8,6203,No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise .,N
9,6203,What a lucky man .,N
10,6203,He still has a complaint though .,N
11,6203,What's that ?,N
12,6203,"He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop .",Y
13,6203,The poor thing . It must be difficult being him .,N

0,6205,"Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ?",Y
1,6205,You can never do that .,N
2,6205,Why ?,N
3,6205,There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . __eou__,N
0,6206,Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are .,Y
1,6206,Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity .,N
2,6206,I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me .,N
3,6206,You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her .,N
4,6206,Nothing rang a bell . __eou__,N
0,6207,"Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll .",N
1,6207,I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one .,Y

3,6208,"You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .",Y
4,6208,No wonder people say,N
5,6208,"Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !",Y
6,6208,I didn't know you liked bird-watching .,N
7,6208,"I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . __eou__",Y
0,6209,I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding .,N
1,6209,"I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful .",N
2,6209,Can ’ t you be more considerate ? I need your encouragement .,N
3,6209,All right . Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs . __eou__,Y
0,6210,What a beautiful view .,N
1,6210,It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this .,N
2,6210,What is that below ?,N
3,6210,It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish .,Y
4,6210,No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me .,N

6,6210,"Yes , there is beautiful view . You can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .",Y
7,6210,It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .,Y
8,6210,That's true . __eou__,N
0,6211,Please fill out the form .,N
1,6211,"All right . ... What's the date today , please ?",N

2,6212,"I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents .",N
3,6212,I didn ’ t know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?,N
4,6212,"We ’ re identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .",Y
5,6212,"Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ?",N
6,6212,"We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father .",N
7,6212,"I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family .",Y
8,6212,What about your step-brother ’ s mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ?,N
9,6212,"No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later .",N
10,6212,Sounds like it was meant to be . __eou__,Y
0,6213,"Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?",Y
1,6213,"My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . What about you ?",N
2,6213,"Well , I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?",Y
3,6213,"For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share .",Y
4,6213,Don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ?,N
5,6213,"No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . What do you think of the one-child policy in China ?",Y
6,6213,"If China didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?",Y
7,6213,"That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy !",Y
8,6213,Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?,N
9,6213,"I don ’ t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! __eou__",Y
0,6214,How is everything going with your girlfriend ?,N

4,6214,Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ?,N
5,6214,"No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home !",N
6,6214,What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ?,N
7,6214,"I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone .",N
8,6214,I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude !,N
9,6214,I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around .,N
10,6214,"I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ?",N
11,6214,I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though .,N
12,6214,"I know . It ’ s always nice to have some closure , but I don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend . __eou__",N

4,6215,What store do you shop at ?,N
5,6215,"The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand .",N
6,6215,I have been using the store across town for years .,N
7,6215,I hear they have very nice stuff .,N
8,6215,"They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items .",N

5,6216,His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there .,N
6,6216,Was it love at first sight ?,N
7,6216,"Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went .",N
8,6216,And ?,N
9,6216,"Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love .",Y
10,6216,That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ?,N
11,6216,"Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated .",Y
12,6216,It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ?,Y

0,6217,"How are you doing , Andrew ?",N
1,6217,Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately .,N
2,6217,But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ?,Y
3,6217,"You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends .",Y
4,6217,What about me ? I ’ m your friend .,Y
5,6217,"I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes .",N
6,6217,"I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ?",N
7,6217,Not at all .,N
8,6217,I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .,Y
9,6217,That ’ s a good idea .,N
10,6217,What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ?,Y
11,6217,I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time .,Y
12,6217,People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club .,Y
13,6217,That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! __eou__,Y
0,6218,"What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?",N
1,6218,My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .,N
2,6218,Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !,N
3,6218,"Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .",Y
4,6218,Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?,N
5,6218,"I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .",N
6,6218,Did your husband's family get to meet your family ?,N
7,6218,"My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family .",Y
8,6218,That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?,N
9,6218,We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .,N
10,6218,"You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?",Y

4,6220,"No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life .",Y
5,6220,"Oh , I see . But a proverb says "" Money makes the mare go . "" I think it will be better if you have more money .",Y
6,6220,Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing .,Y
7,6220,Thank you for your caring . I will .,N
8,6220,No thanks . __eou__,N
0,6221,You like movies ?,N
1,6221,"Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax .",Y
2,6221,What type do you like the best ?,N
3,6221,"Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything .",Y
4,6221,I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it .,Y
5,6221,"Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film .",N
6,6221,True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade .,Y
7,6221,"Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time .",Y
8,6221,I'm totally with you on that . __eou__,N
0,6222,"Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ?",Y
1,6222,"We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do .",N
2,6222,"Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .",Y
3,6222,Like what ?,N
4,6222,"Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .",Y
5,6222,That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ?,N
6,6222,"Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it .",N
7,6222,Is the house pretty run-down .,N
8,6222,"Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her .",N
9,6222,Was it a very old house ?,N
10,6222,"It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .",N
11,6222,Is it in a good location ?,N
12,6222,"The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . __eou__",N
0,6223,The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ?,N
1,6223,"Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head",N
2,6223,Why do you say so ?,N
3,6223,He's always confused by easy questions . __eou__,N
0,6224,Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ?,N
1,6224,No . what's it like ?,N
2,6224,"It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing !",Y
3,6224,Would you want to live there ?,N
4,6224,"I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own .",Y
5,6224,What's your dreamhole like then ?,Y
6,6224,My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England .,Y
7,6224,Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?,N
8,6224,Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important .,Y
9,6224,Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ?,N
10,6224,"No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !",N
11,6224,"I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?",Y
12,6224,"No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more ! __eou__",Y
0,6225,This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty .,N
1,6225,So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it .,N
2,6225,"Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way .",Y
3,6225,You got it . __eou__,N
0,6226,I like your sweater . It suits you very well .,N
1,6226,Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend .,N
2,6226,She certainly has the taste . __eou__,N
0,6227,I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting .,N
1,6227,"Really ? You are a lucky dog . You know , many girls dream of dating him .",N
2,6227,"Yes , I know . He's really on the A-list . __eou__",N
0,6228,"Good morning , Kevin .",N

4,6230,"Let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ?",N
5,6230,"No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner .",Y
6,6230,Don ’ t worry . I will arrange everything .,N
7,6230,"All right , see you tonight .",N
8,6230,See you . __eou__,N
0,6231,You have a nice apartment .,N
1,6231,Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this .,N
2,6231,She must have done a lot of work on it .,N
3,6231,You bet . __eou__,Y
0,6232,"Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ?",N
1,6232,Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten .,N
2,6232,It's nice of you to say so .,N
3,6232,I really appreciate you for having invited me .,N
4,6232,"Don't mention it . You know , we ’ re old friends .",N
5,6232,"Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ?",N
6,6232,Yes . Why ?,N
7,6232,I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook .,N
8,6232,That ’ s great . I'd love to . __eou__,Y
0,6233,"Hi , Bob . Can I have the book back I lent to you last month ?",N
1,6233,"Oh ! I forgot all about it . Of course you can have it back , John . I'm sorry about the delay .",N
2,6233,"Well , it doesn't matter . I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming . __eou__",N
0,6234,Could you lend your bike to me for several days ?,Y
1,6234,How long would you like to keep it ?,N

0,6236,How do you arrange this summer vacation ?,N
1,6236,I want to travel .,Y
2,6236,Where would you like to go ?,Y
3,6236,The seaside .,Y
4,6236,That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .,Y
5,6236,"I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .",N
6,6236,"Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .",N
7,6236,Thank you ! __eou__,N
0,6237,Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ?,N
1,6237,"Ok , you name the day .",Y
2,6237,How about the second of March ?,Y

3,6239,"Fine , see you then . __eou__",N
0,6240,"Now , you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China .",N
1,6240,I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you .,N
2,6240,We are ready to help you .,N
3,6240,"Will you be kind to say "" Thank you "" to Mr.Zhang and other friends for me ?",N
4,6240,I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again .,Y

7,6240,Goodbye ! __eou__,N
0,6241,I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !,N
1,6241,Don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake .,N
2,6241,"It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .",N
3,6241,"But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do .",N
4,6241,"That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth .",N
5,6241,Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ?,N
6,6241,I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow .,Y
7,6241,"Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ?",Y
8,6241,Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .,N
9,6241,"Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money .",N
10,6241,That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work .,Y
11,6241,"If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money .",Y
12,6241,I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! __eou__,Y
0,6242,What's your favorite sport ?,N

1,6245,"Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red .",Y
2,6245,That must be very beautiful .,N
3,6245,"Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies .",Y
4,6245,Really ? Have you ever been there ?,N
5,6245,A couple of times .,N
6,6245,Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me .,Y
7,6245,Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . __eou__,Y
0,6246,"Hello , Hanson . Today I come to say goodbye to you , for I'm going back to London tomorrow .",N
1,6246,"No , not so soon . Couldn ’ t I persuade you to stay a couple of days more ?",N
2,6246,Much as I wish to but I really can ’ t . I've already booked the flight .,N
3,6246,I hope this won ’ t be our last meeting .,N
4,6246,Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance .,N
5,6246,I will miss you .,N
6,6246,"I will miss you , too . You're really a good friend .",N
7,6246,It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow .,N
8,6246,It doesn't matter .,N
9,6246,Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch .,N

3,6249,That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday .,N
4,6249,"I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .",N
5,6249,What's that ?,N
6,6249,"Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .",N
7,6249,"That's annoying , but nothing to worry about .",N
8,6249,"For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?",Y
9,6249,Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .,Y
10,6249,"Ok , I'll try that .",N
11,6249,Is there anything else bothering you ?,N
12,6249,Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .,Y
13,6249,Do you have any other plans this weekend ?,N
14,6249,I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .,N
15,6249,Try not to take on more than you can handle .,N

2,6250,What's the way you keep in contact ?,Y
3,6250,We contact through email .,N
4,6250,Email is not always the best form . I think QQ is way better .,Y

6,6250,You're right . __eou__,N
0,6251,What do you do in your spare time ?,N
1,6251,I listen to music and read .,N

4,6251,"Actually me , too . __eou__",N

4,6324,Wow ! ! And what does your brother do ?,N

0,6326,"Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ?",Y
1,6326,"Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ?",N
2,6326,I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind .,Y
3,6326,Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ .,Y
4,6326,Why ? You seem pretty sure about it .,N
5,6326,Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life .,Y
6,6326,But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it .,N
7,6326,That's why people's achievement varies greatly .,Y
8,6326,"That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them .",Y
9,6326,"Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ?",Y
10,6326,I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives .,Y
11,6326,Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ?,Y
12,6326,Just as Forrest ?,N
13,6326,"Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ .",Y
14,6326,I got it . __eou__,N
0,6327,"Look at this headline , Soo Mi .",Y
1,6327,Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced !,N
2,6327,Is it the same in Korea ?,N
3,6327,"I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together .",N
4,6327,Do people get married young ?,N
5,6327,Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 .,N
6,6327,Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ?,N
7,6327,"No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . __eou__",Y
0,6328,People are funny .,Y
1,6328,They sure are .,N
2,6328,Did you hear about the pilot ?,N
3,6328,The one that stole a small plane ?,N
4,6328,"Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S .",N
5,6328,Did they catch him ?,N
6,6328,"Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway .",N
7,6328,Did he crash ?,N
8,6328,"No , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant .",N
9,6328,Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ?,N
10,6328,His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down .,N
11,6328,Poor guy . __eou__,N
0,6329,The police need our help finding a robber .,N
1,6329,How do you know ?,N
2,6329,The TV news is reporting a bank robbery .,N

4,6329,"Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old .",N
5,6329,What race is he ?,N
6,6329,They didn't say .,N
7,6329,The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore .,Y
8,6329,Of course not . That would be racist .,N
9,6329,But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ?,Y
10,6329,Don't ask me .,N
11,6329,"Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . __eou__",Y
0,6330,"How about you , Chuck ? Where did you grow up ?",N
1,6330,"Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas .",N
2,6330,And when did you come to Los Angeles ?,N
3,6330,In 1978 . I went to college here .,N
4,6330,Oh . What was your major ?,N
5,6330,Drama . I was an actor for five years after college .,Y
6,6330,That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ?,Y
7,6330,Because I needed the money . And because I was good at it . Look ! What do you think ? __eou__,Y
0,6331,"Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ?",N
1,6331,"Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report .",N

1,6332,I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ?,N
2,6332,"Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming .",Y
3,6332,Sounds great !,N
4,6332,"Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room .",Y
5,6332,Do you mean it ? I'd love to ! __eou__,Y

4,6335,That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ?,N
5,6335,"Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago .",N
6,6335,"So , what was the best thing about your trip ?",N
7,6335,"Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . __eou__",N
0,6336,"Mary , it's good to see you !",N
1,6336,Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .,N

3,6336,"Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .",N
4,6336,"Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?",N

4,6338,"Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ?",N
5,6338,That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee .,N
6,6338,I thought that he was with Malia .,N
7,6338,"Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday .",N
8,6338,I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that !,N
9,6338,"Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . __eou__",N
0,6339,He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans .,N
1,6339,I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words .,N
2,6339,Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person .,Y
3,6339,It seems that you don't like him .,N
4,6339,You like to communicate with him ? __eou__,N
0,6340,"How are you feeling , John ?",N
1,6340,"Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed .",N

2,6342,"Nice to meet you , Dolma .",N
3,6342,Good to meet you too . __eou__,N
0,6343,Maybe we all will be all things to all men .,Y
1,6343,How terrible !,N
2,6343,"But for the life , we'll be changed by this society .",Y
3,6343,"I really don't want to go into the world , I feel afraid of it .",N
4,6343,Don't be silly . We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves .,Y
5,6343,I know . __eou__,N
0,6344,"Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .",N
1,6344,"OK , please .",N
2,6344,"My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?",N
3,6344,"I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .",Y
4,6344,"Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?",Y
5,6344,How old are your children ?,N
6,6344,I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .,N
7,6344,I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .,Y
8,6344,It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help . __eou__,N
0,6345,Excuse me . I don't think we have met before . My name is Mary Jenson .,N
1,6345,"Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri .",N
2,6345,"Good to meet you , Mr Chettri .",N
3,6345,"Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson . __eou__",N
0,6346,We should keep Frank at arm's length .,Y
1,6346,Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in .,N
2,6346,He hits below the belt .,N
3,6346,And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . __eou__,Y
0,6347,Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other .,Y
1,6347,In what ways ?,Y
2,6347,"Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible",N
3,6347,"Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ?",N
4,6347,"What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life .",Y
5,6347,Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes !,Y
6,6347,"But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me !",Y
7,6347,"But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met .",Y
8,6347,"Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . __eou__",Y
0,6348,"Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ?",N
1,6348,Temple fair ?,Y
2,6348,"Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now .",Y
3,6348,Sounds interesting !,N
4,6348,"Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common .",Y
5,6348,I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ?,N
6,6348,"What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you .",Y
7,6348,Great ! Do you know how to get there ?,N
8,6348,Of course .,N
9,6348,Couldn't be better . __eou__,N
0,6349,What had make you so upset ?,N
1,6349,Frank has gone out with Lucy again .,N
2,6349,What ’ s wrong with that ?,N
3,6349,"Lucy is known as a social butterfly . She has taken many rich men for a ride , you know . __eou__",N
0,6350,I hear that you are in love with Mike .,N
1,6350,You are kidding .,N
2,6350,Don't you hit it off ?,N
3,6350,"Although we have many things in common , we'are not soul mates . __eou__",Y
0,6351,"What a beautiful view , my sweetheart !",N
1,6351,It sure is.The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this .,N
2,6351,What is that below ?,N
3,6351,It is the Colorado River . You will go down the river in a boat if you wish .,Y
4,6351,"No , thank you.It looks a bit too dangerous for me .",N
5,6351,There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp .,Y
6,6351,"Yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .",Y
7,6351,It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .,Y
8,6351,"You are so romantic , my sweetheart . __eou__",N
0,6352,How is Tom now ?,N
1,6352,He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last .,N
2,6352,Let's congratulate him on Sunday . __eou__,Y
0,6353,I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue .,N
1,6353,"He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ?",N
2,6353,"It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now .",N
3,6353,It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time . __eou__,Y
0,6354,I feel that Bob ’ s father-in-law is a hard nut to crack .,N
1,6354,You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer .,N
2,6354,But his daughter is a very nice girl . __eou__,N
0,6355,What did you say ?,N
1,6355,I said he was nothing but a yeoman .,N
2,6355,Then he become angry with you ?,N
3,6355,Yes . __eou__,N
0,6356,I would back him up to the hilt anyway .,N
1,6356,Why are you so kind to him ?,N
2,6356,He's my brother .,N
3,6356,"So that's how it is ! Now he ’ s in trouble , but I belive he will rise to his own feet again .",Y
4,6356,Thanks for your belief . __eou__,N
0,6357,How is grandpa doing recently ?,N
1,6357,"Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back !",Y
2,6357,Maybe I would talk with him someday .,Y
3,6357,I hope it will be of some use . __eou__,N
0,6358,The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day .,N
1,6358,"Yeah , she has a lot of homework .",N
2,6358,"Today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them .",Y
3,6358,Right . So in some way we are happier .,N
4,6358,"Yeah , at least when we are children , we have not so much homework to do . __eou__",Y
0,6359,"Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us .",Y
1,6359,"Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do .",N
2,6359,Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past .,Y
3,6359,"Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad .",N
4,6359,It's normal . Time will change everything . __eou__,Y
0,6360,It's said that John's broken up .,N
1,6360,Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .,N
2,6360,I hear that John's leading a double wife .,N
3,6360,It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . __eou__,N
0,6361,I don't know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has loused up my business several times .,N
1,6361,You mean Lily's boyfriend ?,N
2,6361,Yeah .,N
3,6361,"Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . __eou__",N
0,6362,Bob is really disturbed these days .,N
1,6362,We'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him .,N
2,6362,But we cannot talk like elders .,N
3,6362,Of course not . Let's talk to him in a very friendly way . __eou__,Y
0,6363,I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down .,N
1,6363,I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste .,N
2,6363,Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . __eou__,Y
0,6364,"If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word .",N
1,6364,You said it . I always count on him when I need his help .,N
2,6364,"Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . __eou__",N
0,6365,"Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man .",N
1,6365,Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior .,N
2,6365,"If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver .",Y
3,6365,"OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . __eou__",N
0,6366,Why are you going out with Andy ?,N
1,6366,Because I like him .,N
2,6366,"Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on . __eou__",N
0,6367,It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists .,Y
1,6367,"I did , but he gives me a runaround .",N
2,6367,"If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table .",Y
3,6367,But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . __eou__,N
0,6368,"Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ?",Y
1,6368,I enjoy camping .,N
2,6368,Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ?,N

7,6368,"Yes , but I threw them back .",N
8,6368,How about Joining our summer camp next week ?,Y
9,6368,Great ! I can't wait . __eou__,N
0,6369,Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J,N
1,6369,"That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it .",Y
2,6369,But it's unfair for Jane . __eou__,N
0,6370,How do you like Tom ?,N
1,6370,I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog .,N
2,6370,Are you ready to welcome him ?,N

3,6371,"Yeah , you're right .",N
4,6371,And have you taken anything for it ?,N
5,6371,"No , I haven't .",N
6,6371,"Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works !",Y
7,6371,Ugh ! __eou__,N
0,6372,"Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem .",Y
1,6372,I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth .,N
2,6372,"Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her .",N
3,6372,I see . OK . __eou__,N
0,6373,It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys .,N
1,6373,Yeah .,N

3,6373,I have found myself a date mate .,N
4,6373,You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun .,Y
5,6373,"A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . __eou__",N
0,6374,Do you know who that tall man is ?,N
1,6374,I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot .,N
2,6374,Why ?,N
3,6374,Because everyone is trying to butter him up . __eou__,N
0,6375,How is he ?,N
1,6375,Not very well . He was white about the gills .,N
2,6375,Did he see the doctor ?,N
3,6375,"Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine .",N
4,6375,Why ?,N
5,6375,I don't know the reason . __eou__,N
0,6376,"I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ?",N
1,6376,"Yeah , it happened a week ago .",N

3,6376,"Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . __eou__",N
0,6377,Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ?,N
1,6377,"I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope .",Y
2,6377,That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ?,N
3,6377,"Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life .",Y
4,6377,What did it say about you then ?,N
5,6377,"For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some "" unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee .",Y
6,6377,But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science .,N
7,6377,"Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it .",Y
8,6377,"For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their "" accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . __eou__",Y

5,6408,"Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him .",N

9,6421,She can't answer you .,N
10,6421,She must be deaf .,N

0,6430,How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?,N

2,6430,Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .,Y
3,6430,But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . __eou__,N
0,6431,"Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ?",N

3,6432,"Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project .",N
4,6432,"That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?",N
5,6432,"Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man .",N

3,6434,"Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .",N
4,6434,It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?,Y
5,6434,"You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .",N
6,6434,What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?,Y
7,6434,Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .,Y
8,6434,What's there after that ?,N
9,6434,"Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .",Y
10,6434,What are they all for ?,N
11,6434,"Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . __eou__",Y
0,6435,"I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working .",N
1,6435,He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep .,N
2,6435,"If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__",N
0,6436,They promised us a sea view .,N
1,6436,"Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys .",Y
2,6436,Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks .,N
3,6436,"Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__",N
0,6437,"Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ?",N
1,6437,"It was wonderful , but I was so tired .",N
2,6437,Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower .,N

4,6437,What else did you see ?,Y
5,6437,"Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say .",Y
6,6437,You must have had a great time .,N

8,6437,Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you .,Y
9,6437,"On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems .",N
10,6437,That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful .,N
11,6437,You'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__,N
0,6438,"Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ?",Y
1,6438,Pardon ?,N
2,6438,What university would you enter ?,N
3,6438,University ? Why ? You asked me last year .,N
4,6438,"Oh , I forget.Sorry .",N
5,6438,I went to Harvard University .,N
6,6438,Did you ? And what course did you take there ?,N
7,6438,God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ?,N
8,6438,"I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory .",N
9,6438,I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ?,N
10,6438,"Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__",Y
0,6439,"You're from New York , aren't you ?",N
1,6439,"Yes , that's right .",N
2,6439,What do you suggest I should see in New York ?,Y
3,6439,"Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?",Y
4,6439,"No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring .",N
5,6439,Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?,Y
6,6439,Ah ! That sounds interesting . __eou__,Y
0,6440,You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ?,N
1,6440,"Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .",N
2,6440,With the job ?,N
3,6440,"With everything , with everybody , with all this !",Y
4,6440,A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday .,Y
5,6440,"It wasn't always like this , you know .",Y
6,6440,What do you mean ?,N
7,6440,"Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives .",Y
8,6440,You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter .,N
9,6440,"Certainly , perhaps . __eou__",Y
0,6441,"Hello , Pam .",N
1,6441,I'm glad that you can make it .,N
2,6441,It looks like there are a lot of people inside .,N
3,6441,Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you .,Y
4,6441,Should I take my shoes off ?,N
5,6441,We all keep our shoes on indoors .,N
6,6441,Where are your parents ?,N
7,6441,They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves .,Y
8,6441,That's great ! __eou__,N
0,6442,We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ?,Y
1,6442,No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ?,Y
2,6442,What about a factory tour ?,Y
3,6442,You mean visit a factory ?,Y
4,6442,Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .,Y
5,6442,Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?,N
6,6442,"I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour .",N
7,6442,Really ? What do the companies do that for ?,N
8,6442,I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .,Y
9,6442,"Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .",Y
10,6442,Exactly .,N
11,6442,Do we need an appointment beforehand ?,N
12,6442,I'll call the tourist information centre to check . __eou__,Y
0,6443,Don't just stand outside . Come on in .,Y
1,6443,Yeah .,N
2,6443,This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean .,N
3,6443,Nice to meet you guys .,N
4,6443,Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team .,N
5,6443,Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ?,N
6,6443,That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ?,N
7,6443,He sure is !,N
8,6443,Come on . I'll introduce you two . __eou__,Y
0,6444,"It's a lovely day , isn't it ?",N
1,6444,"Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice .",N
2,6444,Is she American ?,N
3,6444,"Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams !",N
4,6444,"So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?",Y
5,6444,I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .,N
6,6444,Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?,Y
7,6444,Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .,Y
8,6444,"That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?",N
9,6444,"You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .",Y
10,6444,Good luck !,N
11,6444,Thanks ! __eou__,N
0,6445,Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know .,N
1,6445,I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . __eou__,N
0,6446,"Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ?",N
1,6446,Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ?,N
2,6446,"Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together .",N
3,6446,Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends .,Y
4,6446,"Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything .",Y
5,6446,That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes .,N
6,6446,"When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her .",Y
7,6446,It seems you two bring out the best of one another .,Y
8,6446,Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .,N
9,6446,"Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other .",N
10,6446,"Thanks , I think so too . __eou__",N
0,6447,"Hey , Mary , what's up ?",N
1,6447,Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight .,N
2,6447,"Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ?",N
3,6447,"Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends .",Y
4,6447,It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ?,Y
5,6447,"There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends .",Y
6,6447,"Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty .",Y
7,6447,I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .,N
8,6447,"Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__",Y
0,6448,Good news !,N
1,6448,What is it ?,N
2,6448,The state of economy is starting to go up in our country .,Y
3,6448,That ’ s just the short in the arm we need . __eou__,Y
0,6449,I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport .,N
1,6449,"Oh , thanks a lot .",N
2,6449,What time are you leaving ?,N
3,6449,1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m .,N
4,6449,What airline and what flight ?,N
5,6449,Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 .,N
6,6449,I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P . m .,N
7,6449,Ok . See you tomorrow . __eou__,N
0,6450,I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother .,N
1,6450,Why do you say so ?,N
2,6450,Because he is often in trouble .,N
3,6450,She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin .,N
4,6450,"Oh , I see . __eou__",N
0,6451,"Hi , Michael , how's it going ?",N
1,6451,"Well , things are all right .",N
2,6451,I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ?,N
3,6451,"Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend .",N
4,6451,Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ?,N
5,6451,"She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was "" what's wrong with your voice ? """,N
6,6451,"Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to .",Y
7,6451,I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil .,N
8,6451,"Oh come on , it's not that bad .",N
9,6451,"No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off .",N
10,6451,Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking .,N
11,6451,That's the plan .,N
12,6451,Good luck . __eou__,N
0,6452,I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love .,N
1,6452,Very romantic ?,N
2,6452,Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .,N
3,6452,You married him for that reason ?,N
4,6452,Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other . __eou__,N
0,6453,"Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue .",Y
1,6453,Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ?,N
2,6453,"Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful .",N
3,6453,I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ?,Y
4,6453,I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last .,Y
5,6453,"Yeah , that's nice .",N
6,6453,"Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home .",Y
7,6453,A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ?,Y
8,6453,I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .,N
9,6453,I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . __eou__,Y
0,6454,Do you feel better ?,N
1,6454,Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me .,N
2,6454,Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine .,N
3,6454,Thanks a lot . You are so kind . __eou__,N
0,6455,It is too bad today .,N
1,6455,What happened ?,N
2,6455,"My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .",N
3,6455,How did you find him at last ?,N
4,6455,It was the police wo helped me to do that .,N
5,6455,It must have taught you a lesson this time . __eou__,N
0,6456,Did you get the car you wanted ?,N
1,6456,No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it .,N
2,6456,What about the car over there ?,Y
3,6456,"It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . __eou__",N
0,6457,Today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding .,N
1,6457,That must be a long love story .,N
2,6457,Yeah . They promised to stick together forever when they were young .,N
3,6457,They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ?,N
4,6457,I don ’ t know . __eou__,N
0,6458,"Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep .",N
1,6458,Shift it a little before you get up .,N
2,6458,And I need to stretch my legs now . __eou__,N
0,6459,Tim ’ s smiles are interesting .,Y
1,6459,"Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .",Y
2,6459,You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .,N
3,6459,How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! __eou__,Y
0,6460,"What's this , I wonder ?",Y
1,6460,I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder .,Y
2,6460,A coffee grinder ?,Y
3,6460,"Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans .",N
4,6460,"Oh , that would be very useful . __eou__",Y
0,6461,What do you think of smoking ?,N
1,6461,It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others .,Y
2,6461,What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?,Y
3,6461,Stop producing cigarettes .,N
4,6461,But that ’ ll affect the national economy .,N
5,6461,That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways .,N
6,6461,How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?,Y
7,6461,Maybe it can take effect . __eou__,Y
0,6462,Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ?,N
1,6462,I heard it might rain .,N
2,6462,Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills .,N
3,6462,Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead .,Y
4,6462,Yes that might be a better idea .,Y
5,6462,Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too .,Y

3,6465,You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking .,N
4,6465,But you should make up your mind first .,N
5,6465,You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake .,N
6,6465,Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work .,Y
7,6465,Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . __eou__,N
0,6466,Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .,N
1,6466,I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .,N
2,6466,Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .,Y
3,6466,"No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . __eou__",Y
0,6467,"Hey , where's Cindy ?",N

0,6468,I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ?,N
1,6468,I think you'd better apologize .,N
2,6468,"Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault .",N
3,6468,"Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . __eou__",N
0,6469,"We used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship .",Y
1,6469,What do you mean ?,N
2,6469,"I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him .",N
3,6469,She is a grow-up . She can make her own decision .,N
4,6469,I wish she wouldn ’ t regret for her decision . __eou__,N
0,6470,"Well , everything is packed and ready to go .",N
1,6470,It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream .,N

3,6470,And the people were so friendly !,Y
4,6470,"Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals .",N
5,6470,Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ?,N
6,6470,Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had .,N
7,6470,I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day .,N
8,6470,If only we could eat there once more !,Y
9,6470,Maybe we can come here again next summer .,Y
10,6470,Hope the restaurant is still there .,N
11,6470,"Hey , what's the time ?",N
12,6470,"Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now .",N
13,6470,Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright . __eou__,N
0,6471,"Are you feeling better today , Bill ?",N
1,6471,"Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening .",N
2,6471,You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health .,N
3,6471,"You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit .",N
4,6471,But you should make up your mind first .,N
5,6471,"You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake .",Y

6,6472,"Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .",N
7,6472,"You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street .",Y
8,6472,There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .,Y
9,6472,"Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way .",Y

7,6473,They just announced the boarding call .,N
8,6473,Then we've got to get going .,N
9,6473,OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing .,N
10,6473,Thank you again for all your help .,N
11,6473,Bye . __eou__,N
0,6474,"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .",Y
1,6474,"Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .",Y
2,6474,But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .,Y
3,6474,But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .,N
4,6474,"Well , only you liked it really , darling .",N

0,6477,Guess who I saw just now ?,N

5,6479,"Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?",N

8,6479,Mrs . Thou ?,N
9,6479,"Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .",Y
10,6479,Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !,Y

1,6485,"Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten .",N

5,6488,"It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you .",N
6,6488,I'll tell you all about it next Monday .,N
7,6488,"Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__",N
0,6489,I couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them .,N
1,6489,What was wrong ?,N
2,6489,You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone .,N
3,6489,I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone .,N
4,6489,"I know , I know . But someone took offence . __eou__",N
0,6490,"So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ?",N

1,6492,How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .,Y
2,6492,That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .,Y
3,6492,"Me , too . What did you have in mind ?",Y
4,6492,"I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .",Y
5,6492,"I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan",N
6,6492,"Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?",N

7,6493,"Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . __eou__",Y
0,6494,"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?",Y
1,6494,That's because Americans love sitcoms .,N
2,6494,Sitcoms ?,Y
3,6494,"Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .",Y
4,6494,"In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .",Y
5,6494,I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . __eou__,Y
0,6495,Have you been to Shanghai before ?,N

5,6500,It was no big deal .,N
6,6500,What do your parents think of your dating a boy ?,N

8,6500,They're glad ? ! __eou__,N
0,6501,Is Jack still staying idle everyday ?,N

5,6502,Oh really ! That sounds lovely . __eou__,N
0,6503,Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ?,N
1,6503,"Well , Brad from school asked me out just today .",N
2,6503,Brad Bush ? Good for you !,N
3,6503,But I don't know what to do .,N
4,6503,You mean you've never had a boyfriend ?,N
5,6503,My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college .,N
6,6503,Until college ?,N
7,6503,"Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . __eou__",Y
0,6504,I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night .,N
1,6504,"Are you angry , Lisa ?",N
2,6504,Angry ? Why would I be ?,N
3,6504,Please don't tell my mom .,N
4,6504,"Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already .",Y
5,6504,I'm glad that you see it that way .,N
6,6504,Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you .,N

3,6505,"Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy !",Y

5,6505,"So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ?",N
6,6505,Of course ! __eou__,Y
0,6506,Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?,Y
1,6506,"Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight .",Y
2,6506,What are they ?,N
3,6506,One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families .,Y
4,6506,Why ?,N
5,6506,"The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis .",N
6,6506,That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .,Y
7,6506,And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat .,Y
8,6506,What's that ?,N
9,6506,Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day !,Y
10,6506,"Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .",Y
11,6506,"Yeah , I guess so .",N

3,6507,"Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ?",N
4,6507,Well how about meeting at my place ?,Y
5,6507,That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . __eou__,N
0,6508,So do you think you can get to the office alone ?,N
1,6508,"Sure , I ’ ll catch the train . If I can ’ t catch the train , I ’ ll get a taxi .",Y
2,6508,Do you think the taxi driver will understand you ?,N
3,6508,"If he doesn ’ t understand me , I ’ ll show him the office address on my business card .",N

2,6552,Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .,N
3,6552,That's true . __eou__,N

3,6556,"No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now .",N
4,6556,It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps .,Y
5,6556,It certainly is . It's so much fun .,N
6,6556,I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ?,Y
7,6556,Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world .,Y
8,6556,"Well , every stamp has a story to tell .",Y

3,6558,Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .,Y
4,6558,"I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?",Y

7,6558,Thank you . __eou__,N

3,6559,"Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ?",N
4,6559,I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . __eou__,N
0,6560,Jack and Mary broke up .,N
1,6560,It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?,N
2,6560,"Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .",N
3,6560,"Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ?",N
4,6560,"No , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time .",N
5,6560,Maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .,Y
6,6560,How so ?,N
7,6560,He is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them .,Y
8,6560,Poor Mary ! She really liked him .,N
9,6560,"Anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better .",N
10,6560,Do you think they ’ ll get back together ?,N

2,6561,"To be honest , I'm a bit fed up .",N
3,6561,What's wrong ?,N
4,6561,There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .,N
5,6561,I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?,N
6,6561,"Sure , but how ?",Y
7,6561,You can ask her out for drink after work .,Y
8,6561,But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am .,N
9,6561,Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first .,Y
10,6561,Easier said than done .,N
11,6561,You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her .,Y
12,6561,But I always get tongue-tied when I see her .,N
13,6561,That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased .,N
14,6561,I see . I'll try .,Y
15,6561,Good luck . __eou__,N
0,6562,Have you ever run into a person who tries to bleed you white ?,Y
1,6562,I am always on the look out for such girls .,N

4,6564,Is everything ready now ?,N
5,6564,"Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .",Y
6,6564,Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .,N
7,6564,"Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .",N
8,6564,"It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .",N
9,6564,That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .,Y
10,6564,I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .,Y
11,6564,Thank you .,N
12,6564,My pleasure . __eou__,N
0,6565,"This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up .",N
1,6565,Are you serious ?,N
2,6565,"Yes , I mean it .",N
3,6565,But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?,N
4,6565,"No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working .",N
5,6565,"Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things .",Y
6,6565,I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us .,Y

13,6565,"I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit .",Y
14,6565,I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart .,Y
15,6565,Shall we keep pur friendship ?,N

0,6570,Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off .,N
1,6570,What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face .,N

2,6578,What did you do to get his goat ?,N
3,6578,"When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . __eou__",N
0,6579,"Henry , don ’ t get out of doing housework .",N
1,6579,It ’ s none of my business .,N
2,6579,You mean that is my business .,N

0,6582,To be a revolutionary needs great courage !,Y

2,6604,You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .,N
3,6604,That give us a good lesson . __eou__,N
0,6605,Why are you so rude to your wife ?,N
1,6605,I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box .,N

11,6662,"Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car .",Y
12,6662,That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation !,N
13,6662,Thank you very much ! __eou__,N
0,6663,Sandra is actually a blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women .,N
1,6663,That's fate .,N
2,6663,I feel sorry for her .,N
3,6663,Maybe this is God's will . __eou__,Y
0,6664,"Hi , Jenny . Are still working ?",N

6,6664,"Yes , could you please go over this for me ? And see if there is any mistake in it ?",N
7,6664,Oh . All right I'll read it soon .,N
8,6664,Excuse me for taking your time .,N
9,6664,It's nothing Nancy . __eou__,N
0,6665,"Um , which of them is the better typist ?",N
1,6665,"Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully .",Y
2,6665,Is there any difference in their short hand ?,N
3,6665,"Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class .",Y
4,6665,How about languages ?,Y
5,6665,Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does .,N
6,6665,Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . __eou__,Y
0,6666,What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?,N
1,6666,I'm sorry . I forget all about it .,N
2,6666,How could you ? I reminded you just this morning .,Y

0,6667,Is there anything wrong ?,N
1,6667,I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .,N
2,6667,Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .,N
3,6667,I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .,N
4,6667,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .,Y
5,6667,But I just want to give her some tips .,N
6,6667,"Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__",Y
0,6668,Bob refused all his classmates ' invitations .,N
1,6668,I really couldn't understand him .,N
2,6668,"He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him .",N
3,6668,We'd better also leave him alone . __eou__,N
0,6669,Does your wife work ?,N
1,6669,"Yes , she does . She works at home .",N
2,6669,"Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ?",N
3,6669,"Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer .",N

0,6670,"I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby !",Y
1,6670,My first grandchild .,N
2,6670,"And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does .",N
3,6670,"Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though .",N
4,6670,"Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does .",N
5,6670,"Well , children usually resemble their parents .",N
6,6670,It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is .,Y
7,6670,You often like comparing children with their parents .,N
8,6670,You ’ re right . __eou__,N
0,6671,All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull .,N
1,6671,"Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls .",Y
2,6671,Then why are you wearing black shoes ?,N
3,6671,"Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go .",N
4,6671,"Hey , thanks , mum . __eou__",N
0,6672,"I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide .",N
1,6672,"Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 .",N
2,6672,"I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference .",Y
3,6672,"Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ?",N
4,6672,"I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . __eou__",Y
0,6673,Did you go to the movie yesterday ?,N
1,6673,"Yes , I did .",N
2,6673,What did you think of it ?,N
3,6673,I don't think much of the film .,N
4,6673,I think it is the worst one I have ever seen .,N
5,6673,"Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad .",N
6,6673,I can't think the same .,Y
7,6673,"What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children .",Y
8,6673,I couldn't agree with you . __eou__,N
0,6674,Doesn't she have any friends ?,N
1,6674,"If she has , they must be fair-weather friends .",N
2,6674,Such friends are even worse than enemies .,N
3,6674,She'd better keep away from them . __eou__,N
0,6675,I think modern painting means nothing .,N
1,6675,I think so too . It's just pointless .,N
2,6675,Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ?,N
3,6675,I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy .,N
4,6675,Maybe . __eou__,Y
0,6676,Have you heard about Alice and David ?,N
1,6676,"No , have they had another fight ?",N
2,6676,"No , they've got engaged .",N
3,6676,You must be joking . Those two ?,N
4,6676,"Well , my dear , I didn't believe it either . But I got it straight from the horse's mouth . David called me this morning .",N
5,6676,So when did this all happen ?,N
6,6676,"Last weekend , while they were on their ski trip .",N
7,6676,"Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ?",N

5,6677,How amazing ! __eou__,N
0,6678,Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ?,N
1,6678,I suppose I do .,N
2,6678,The climate here is pleasant .,N
3,6678,You said it .,N
4,6678,This city is really comfortable to live in .,N
5,6678,It sure is .,N
6,6678,No other city can match it . It's heaven .,N
7,6678,"Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much .",Y
8,6678,Maybe .,Y
9,6678,That's for sure . __eou__,N
0,6679,You say he was around average height .,N
1,6679,"Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten .",N
2,6679,Weight ?,N

4,6679,Any marks on his face ?,N
5,6679,"No , I don't think so .",N
6,6679,Glasses ?,N
7,6679,No .,N
8,6679,What about his hair ?,Y
9,6679,Black or dark brown .,N
10,6679,Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ?,Y
11,6679,"Straight , I think , and about average length",N

2,6680,How can you be so sure ?,N
3,6680,I can tell from the way he spoke to us .,N
4,6680,Never believe his words . __eou__,N

1,6682,I was the only one who got a strait A in my class .,N
2,6682,Congratulations on your success .,N
3,6682,Thank you . __eou__,N
0,6683,"If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ?",N
1,6683,Why ? Did tom pop the question ?,N
2,6683,Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent .,Y
3,6683,"Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ?",N
4,6683,You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place .,N
5,6683,I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex .,N
6,6683,"Oh , how did you deal with it ?",N
7,6683,I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up .,N
8,6683,"Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ?",N
9,6683,Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences .,N
10,6683,Like what ?,N
11,6683,He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family .,N
12,6683,"Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first .",Y
13,6683,"Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working .",N
14,6683,So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .,N
15,6683,Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . __eou__,Y
0,6684,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?,N
1,6684,"Sorry , I thought you knew .",N
2,6684,But you should have told me you were in love with her .,N
3,6684,Didn't I ?,N
4,6684,You know you didn't .,N
5,6684,"Well , I'm telling you now .",N
6,6684,"Yes , but you might have told me before .",N
7,6684,I didn't think you'd be interested .,N
8,6684,You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?,N
9,6684,"Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .",N
10,6684,"Oh , you men ! You're all the same . __eou__",N
0,6685,My old man always harps on me .,N
1,6685,So does my father . I'm already used to it .,N
2,6685,"But I can't bear it , John .",N
3,6685,How dare you say that ? What they do is just for our good .,N
4,6685,"Yeah , but he really puts blame on me . __eou__",N
0,6686,Who did the stupid thing ?,N
1,6686,Maybe it was Dick .,Y
2,6686,I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that .,N
3,6686,Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__,N
0,6687,"I love slim girls , don ’ t you ?",N
1,6687,Not particularly . I like fat girls .,N
2,6687,"And I like a girl with good skin , do you ?",N
3,6687,I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners .,N
4,6687,"Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure .",N
5,6687,Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality .,N
6,6687,"But you like a girl to be rich , surely ?",N
7,6687,Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . __eou__,N
0,6688,"Nice to see you , Patrick .",N
1,6688,Bob ! I hear your team won the match .,N
2,6688,Yeah . All of us tried our best .,N

2,6689,"Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ?",N
3,6689,"My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .",N
4,6689,"I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me .",N
5,6689,I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?,N
6,6689,"Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children .",N
7,6689,Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?,Y
8,6689,"The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day .",Y
9,6689,Do you get along well with each other ?,N
10,6689,"Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot .",N
11,6689,You are very lucky to have such a nice family .,N
12,6689,Thank you . __eou__,N

1,6690,"Sorry , I can ’ t .",N
2,6690,"Tomorrow night , then ?",N
3,6690,I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t .,Y
4,6690,I was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .,Y
5,6690,That sounds great .,N
6,6690,"Ok . How about give me a ring , then ?",Y
7,6690,No . I ’ d better not .,N
8,6690,Why not ?,Y
9,6690,Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . __eou__,N
0,6691,"Jenny , are you having fun here ?",N
1,6691,"Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .",N

3,6692,I really appreciated it .,N
4,6692,I was happy to help .,N
5,6692,It was so kind of you .,N
6,6692,Don ’ t mention it .,N
7,6692,You ’ re a real friend in need . __eou__,N
0,6693,When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ?,N
1,6693,Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter .,N
2,6693,How about Sunday then ?,Y
3,6693,"Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ?",N
4,6693,"Does 6,30 suit you ?",N
5,6693,It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then .,N
6,6693,"Thanks , goodbye . __eou__",N
0,6694,Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?,N
1,6694,"Oh , that sounds great !",N
2,6694,"I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ?",N
3,6694,"Yes , that would be perfect .",N
4,6694,See you tonight then .,N
5,6694,Yes . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__,N
0,6695,"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?",N
1,6695,"It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume .",N
2,6695,I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that .,N
3,6695,That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . __eou__,N
0,6696,Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ?,N
1,6696,What ’ s it for ?,N
2,6696,It ’ s for a book .,N
3,6696,"Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture .",Y
4,6696,Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__,N
0,6697,Are you doing anything tonight ?,N
1,6697,"No , nothing . Why ?",N
2,6697,Do you like western music ?,N
3,6697,"Yes , I do , very much .",N
4,6697,There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ?,N
5,6697,"Oh , yes . I ’ d love to . __eou__",Y
0,6698,I decided to go for this kind of life .,Y
1,6698,Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take .,Y
2,6698,I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .,Y
3,6698,Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__,N
0,6699,"Hi , how are you doing ?",N
1,6699,Everything's great . And you ?,N
2,6699,Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ?,N
3,6699,"No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called "" Chinese-Style Divorce "" .",N
4,6699,Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking .,Y
5,6699,Yeah . I found it is so close to our life .,Y
6,6699,It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world .,Y
7,6699,"You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year .",N
8,6699,"Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too .",Y
9,6699,I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married .,N
10,6699,"Oh , that's too short-lived .",N
11,6699,That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation .,N
12,6699,II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage .,Y
13,6699,Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously .,N
14,6699,"In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone .",Y
15,6699,"I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage . __eou__",Y
0,6700,"Hello , Deva , how are you ?",N
1,6700,Can't complain . What about you ?,N
2,6700,Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?,N
3,6700,I've heard . She looks quite depressed .,N
4,6700,Yes . They used to be joined at the hip .,N
5,6700,I heard they were just married for 5 months .,N
6,6700,"Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things .",N
7,6700,Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden .,Y
8,6700,"You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage .",N
9,6700,Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married .,Y
10,6700,Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .,Y
11,6700,Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce .,N
12,6700,We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners .,N
13,6700,That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__,N
0,6701,I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him .,N
1,6701,Why don't you find someone who is in the know .,Y
2,6701,"I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know .",Y
3,6701,"Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him .",Y
4,6701,Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . __eou__,N

3,6702,Why ? You mean a lot to me .,N
4,6702,Why didn ’ t you answer my question ?,N
5,6702,What question ?,N
6,6702,"Do you love me ? Come on , I ’ m eager to hear .",N
7,6702,You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you .,N
8,6702,"Don ’ t cherish your words , dear .",N
9,6702,I---I don ’ t feel like saying it __eou__,N
0,6703,What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ?,N
1,6703,"To be honest , I wouldn't .",N
2,6703,Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ?,N
3,6703,Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time .,N
4,6703,What's the puzzle ?,Y
5,6703,"My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids .",N
6,6703,"Oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way .",Y
7,6703,Yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night .,N
8,6703,"Oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .",Y
9,6703,But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not .,Y
10,6703,Definitely .,Y
11,6703,"You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness .",Y
12,6703,"Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .",Y
13,6703,I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child .,N
14,6703,Sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . __eou__,N
0,6704,We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ?,N
1,6704,I'm very sorry I can't .,N
2,6704,Why not ?,Y
3,6704,I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business . __eou__,N
0,6705,Do you know Sally ?,N
1,6705,Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .,Y
2,6705,Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock .,N
3,6705,"Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . __eou__",Y
0,6706,"I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up .",N
1,6706,Don't be scared . Bite the bullet and everything will be right again .,N
2,6706,Thanks for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will overcome them one by one . __eou__,Y
0,6707,You know John ?,N
1,6707,Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ?,N
2,6707,Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper .,N
3,6707,And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam .,N
4,6707,I wish he could too .,N
5,6707,"How ’ s your boy , Jack ?",N
6,6707,"He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .",N

13,6730,"But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ?",Y
14,6730,Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast .,Y
15,6730,Have you seen a lot of them ?,N
16,6730,I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone .,N

10,6732,It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .,N
11,6732,"Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",N
12,6732,Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .,Y
13,6732,"Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",N
14,6732,It really hurts .,N

16,6732,To hell with you . The accident was your fault .,N
17,6732,"I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",N

2,6820,But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that .,N
3,6820,How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help . __eou__,Y
0,6821,He is penny wise and pound-foolish .,N
1,6821,Why do you say so ?,N
2,6821,"The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .",Y

0,6824,"He thought he could take Jimmy in , but you know , Jimmy is no fool .",Y

3,6836,No wonder . __eou__,N
0,6837,I don ’ t dare to look after the children now .,N
1,6837,Why ?,N
2,6837,The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them .,N

2,6841,Have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ?,N
3,6841,Get the goods on her ? She never allows me to go to her office . And she is a good woman . She has been faithful all these years .,N

0,6845,The government has to face a lot of social problems now .,Y
1,6845,I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems .,Y

2,7054,I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks .,N
3,7054,"No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks .",N

0,7055,I think your speech was excellent .,N
1,7055,Was it ?,N
2,7055,Sure it was .,N
3,7055,"Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know .",N
4,7055,But you did it and did it well ! __eou__,N
0,7056,"Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock .",N
1,7056,"What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ...",N
2,7056,"I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that .",N
3,7056,"I see . Where are you now , Li ?",Y
4,7056,Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge .,N
5,7056,"It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ?",Y
6,7056,"I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi !",Y
7,7056,"That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock .",N
8,7056,I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting .,N
9,7056,It doesn't matter.Bye .,N
10,7056,Bye . __eou__,N
0,7057,"Why , Tom ? It's five to six already and you are still writing here .",N
1,7057,So what ? Are we going anywhere ?,N
2,7057,"Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight .",N
3,7057,"Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it.Well , can I take a rain check ?",N
4,7057,What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there .,N
5,7057,"I'm terribly sorry , Rose.But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me . __eou__",N
0,7058,I really like the book you lent me the other day .,N
1,7058,I'm glad you like it .,N
2,7058,And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .,N
3,7058,Not at all .,N
4,7058,Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting .,N
5,7058,"Oh , I'm glad .",N
6,7058,Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?,N
7,7058,No problem . __eou__,N
0,7059,You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ?,N
1,7059,"I'm sorry , It's all my fault .",N
2,7059,You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her .,N
3,7059,"Sorry , I had no intention .",N
4,7059,"It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ?",N
5,7059,"I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me . __eou__",Y
0,7060,We can't wait any longer ...,N
1,7060,I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ...,N
2,7060,You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ?,N
3,7060,I can't afford to .,N
4,7060,"All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ?",Y

1,7061,It's us .,N
2,7061,What do you mean by us ?,N
3,7061,"Well , you always say you're busy .",N
4,7061,That's right .,N
5,7061,And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .,N
6,7061,"I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me .",N
7,7061,"Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it .",N
8,7061,You mean I am groaned a few words ?,N

0,7064,You ’ re all set now ?,N
1,7064,"Oh , thank you so much .",N
2,7064,"Really , it was nothing .",N
3,7064,I really appreciated it .,N
4,7064,I was happy to help .,N
5,7064,It was so kind of you .,N
6,7064,Don ’ t mention it .,N
7,7064,You ’ re a real friend in need . __eou__,N
0,7065,Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ?,N
1,7065,What ’ s it for ?,N
2,7065,It ’ s for a book .,N
3,7065,"Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture .",Y
4,7065,Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__,N
0,7066,"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ?",N
1,7066,"It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume .",N
2,7066,I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that .,N
3,7066,That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . __eou__,N
0,7067,Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ?,N
1,7067,I don ’ t really mind .,N
2,7067,We can go to that new Chinese restaurant .,Y
3,7067,I suppose I could .,Y
4,7067,"Come on , let ’ s try it .",Y
5,7067,All right . If you really want to . __eou__,Y
0,7068,How about a movie tonight ?,Y
1,7068,It doesn ’ t matter to me .,N
2,7068,Does 7 o'clock suit you ?,N
3,7068,Either way . I don ’ t care .,N
4,7068,How about a snack after work ?,Y
5,7068,I couldn ’ t careless .,N
6,7068,Would you rather stay home ?,N
7,7068,Whatever you say .,N
8,7068,Are you really interested in doing something ?,N
9,7068,I don ’ t mind if you want to . __eou__,N
0,7069,Look ! It ’ s the start of the Olympic Games .,N
1,7069,So what ?,N
2,7069,"You want to watch , don ’ t you ?",N
3,7069,Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games .,N
4,7069,Please yourself . __eou__,N
0,7070,"You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?",N
1,7070,Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest .,N
2,7070,Really ? Congratulations !,N
3,7070,"Thank you , Paul .",N
4,7070,"By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .",N
5,7070,"Good , happy birthday to you !",N
6,7070,"Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?",N
7,7070,"Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .",N
8,7070,My pleasure . __eou__,N
0,7071,I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening .,N
1,7071,What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ?,N
2,7071,Helen is nice but she talks a lot .,N
3,7071,Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film .,N
4,7071,It sure is . __eou__,N
0,7072,I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job .,N
1,7072,"Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying .",Y
2,7072,But I don't even know what to study .,N
3,7072,"If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language .",Y
4,7072,That's what my parents want me to do .,N
5,7072,"You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing .",N
6,7072,"But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun .",Y
7,7072,"Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age .",N
8,7072,"And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too .",Y
9,7072,You're right . Thank you for the advice . __eou__,N
0,7073,"Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ?",N
1,7073,"nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember .",N
2,7073,Are you sure you cann't remember ?,N
3,7073,I've absolutely certain .,N
4,7073,Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ?,N
5,7073,I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine .,N
6,7073,Did you see anyone come into the block flats ?,N
7,7073,"No , I didn't .",N
8,7073,Sure ?,N
9,7073,Quite sure . __eou__,N
0,7074,Do you take a bus to and from work ?,N
1,7074,"Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .",Y
2,7074,"Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .",Y
3,7074,"Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .",N
4,7074,"That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .",N
5,7074,What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?,N
6,7074,"You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !",N
7,7074,"Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?",N
8,7074,"Yeah , absolutely !",Y
9,7074,"And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .",N
10,7074,"You were so happy , weren ’ t you ?",N
11,7074,What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . __eou__,N
0,7075,"Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house .",N
1,7075,I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself !,N
2,7075,That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent .,N
3,7075,It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own .,N
4,7075,They see their independence as a kind of character strength .,Y
5,7075,Sometimes they are too independent . __eou__,N
0,7076,"Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend .",N
1,7076,A house warming party ?,Y
2,7076,"Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn .",N
3,7076,Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy .,N
4,7076,"Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive .",Y
5,7076,"I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city .",Y
6,7076,That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .,Y
7,7076,"I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . __eou__",Y
0,7077,"Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you .",N
1,7077,Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine .,N
2,7077,"You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?",N
3,7077,"No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent .",N
4,7077,Do you ever get lonely living alone ?,N
5,7077,"Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! __eou__",Y
0,7078,"Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door .",N
1,7078,"Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors .",N
2,7078,I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly .,N
3,7078,"This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here .",N
4,7078,"Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors .",Y
5,7078,"So , tell me , Karl , why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live ?",Y
6,7078,"We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! __eou__",Y
0,7079,I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people .,Y
1,7079,And what did the program say ?,N
2,7079,It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier .,Y
3,7079,I think that many physicians now agree with that idea .,N
4,7079,And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .,Y
5,7079,"And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . __eou__",Y
0,7080,"Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ?",N
1,7080,Umm ... I think so . What's up ?,N
2,7080,I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim .,N
3,7080,Really ? Are you OK ?,N
4,7080,I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ?,N
5,7080,If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered .,N
6,7080,"Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ?",Y
7,7080,"Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too .",N
8,7080,"That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ?",N
9,7080,"Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider .",Y
10,7080,"So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ?",N
11,7080,That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . __eou__,N
0,7081,"So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?",Y
1,7081,"Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown .",N
2,7081,That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ?,N
3,7081,I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ?,N
4,7081,"I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place .",N
5,7081,You mean they're kicking you out ?,N
6,7081,"Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out .",N
7,7081,"Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so .",N
8,7081,"My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own .",Y
9,7081,"I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . __eou__",Y
0,7082,"So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ?",N
1,7082,Nine total . Seven children and my parents .,N
2,7082,Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ?,N
3,7082,"Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it .",Y
4,7082,"Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .",N
5,7082,"It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make .",N
6,7082,Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy .,Y
7,7082,"That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs .",Y
8,7082,And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common .,Y
9,7082,Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .,Y
10,7082,"Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .",N
11,7082,"They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . __eou__",N
0,7083,"Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon .",N
1,7083,Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby .,N
2,7083,Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday .,N
3,7083,"Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own .",N
4,7083,"In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese .",Y
5,7083,"Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ?",N
6,7083,It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now .,N
7,7083,"Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? __eou__",Y
0,7084,Do you have much experience with kids ?,N
1,7084,Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson .,N
2,7084,"To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .",N
3,7084,I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home .,N
4,7084,What about your mother ? Did she help you ?,N
5,7084,"Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time .",Y
6,7084,"I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day .",Y
7,7084,Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work .,Y
8,7084,"Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn .",N
9,7084,"No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . __eou__",N
0,7085,"Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ?",N
1,7085,I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime .,N
2,7085,No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ?,N
3,7085,"I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall .",N
4,7085,You must have a wonderful time .,N
5,7085,"Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ?",N
6,7085,"No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps .",N
7,7085,"Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? __eou__",Y
0,7086,"How good are you at sports , Bill ?",N
1,7086,Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week .,N
2,7086,Wow !,N
3,7086,"Do you like sports , Janice ?",N
4,7086,"Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things .",N
5,7086,"Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ?",N
6,7086,"Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward .",Y
7,7086,That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before .,N
8,7086,"Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding .",Y
9,7086,"Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . __eou__",N
0,7087,I can ’ t wait to retire .,N
1,7087,And then what ?,N
2,7087,"And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day !",N
3,7087,That sounds boring to me .,N
4,7087,What do you plan on doing after you retire ?,Y
5,7087,"Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher .",Y
6,7087,"I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . __eou__",Y
0,7088,"Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ?",N
1,7088,Uh ... what game ?,N
2,7088,Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points !,N
3,7088,Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ?,N
4,7088,Football of course !,Y
5,7088,Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals .,N
6,7088,"No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer .",N
7,7088,"Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there .",N
8,7088,So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ?,N
9,7088,"Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ?",N
10,7088,"Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football .",Y
11,7088,It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ?,Y
12,7088,"Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . __eou__",Y
0,7089,"I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday .",Y
1,7089,Really ? Do I look happy all the time ?,N
2,7089,All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers .,Y
3,7089,"Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive !",Y
4,7089,"Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you .",N
5,7089,"Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring .",N
6,7089,It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week .,N
7,7089,But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?,Y
8,7089,Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ?,Y
9,7089,"Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first .",Y
10,7089,"Oh , I know . Thank you . __eou__",N
0,7090,"Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ?",N
1,7090,I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills .,N
2,7090,Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are .,N
3,7090,At least you know what American women generally like in a man .,N
4,7090,"Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard .",Y
5,7090,"American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances .",N
6,7090,"No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants .",Y
7,7090,"You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise .",Y
8,7090,"Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . __eou__",Y
0,7091,"Hi , Kate .",N
1,7091,"Hi , Don . What a surprise !",N
2,7091,"Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now .",N
3,7091,Have you noticed what has changed ?,Y
4,7091,"Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ?",N
5,7091,"Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds .",N
6,7091,"Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break .",Y
7,7091,What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday .,Y
8,7091,Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that .,N
9,7091,Sure . Join my class next week . __eou__,Y
0,7092,"Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat !",N
1,7092,Wow ! Sure !,Y
2,7092,I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch .,N
3,7092,Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying !,N
4,7092,I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about .,Y
5,7092,I'd love to help if I can .,Y
6,7092,"Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate !",Y
7,7092,Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain .,N
8,7092,But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ?,N
9,7092,"Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know .",N
10,7092,"I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name .",Y
11,7092,"Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ?",Y
12,7092,"I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans .",N
13,7092,I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think .,Y
14,7092,Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare .,Y
15,7092,"Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . __eou__",N
0,7093,"Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ?",N
1,7093,I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work .,N
2,7093,"Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition .",Y
3,7093,"It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ?",N
4,7093,"You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful .",Y
5,7093,"Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork !",Y
6,7093,"But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body .",Y
7,7093,So a deadline will cause that same reaction ?,Y
8,7093,"It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds !",Y
9,7093,So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? __eou__,Y
0,7094,"Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ?",N
1,7094,Coming as ?,N
2,7094,Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume !,Y
3,7094,"Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there .",N
4,7094,Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ?,N
5,7094,"Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit .",Y
6,7094,Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ?,Y
7,7094,"Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry .",Y
8,7094,Feed them ?,Y
9,7094,"Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts .",Y
10,7094,And then later everyone eats the food ?,Y
11,7094,Yes ! How did you guess that ?,N
12,7094,"It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ?",N
13,7094,Good Point !,N
14,7094,"But no dressing up like ghosts , right ?",N
15,7094,No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? __eou__,Y
0,7095,I heard you are going to move .,N
1,7095,"Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying .",N
2,7095,What are you worried about ?,N
3,7095,"I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff .",N
4,7095,You can call a mover .,Y
5,7095,How much dose that cost ?,N
6,7095,Around 200 RIB for a truck .,N
7,7095,I think it ’ s a little expensive .,N
8,7095,"But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save .",Y
9,7095,That ’ s right .,N
10,7095,I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number .,Y
11,7095,Wonderful .,N
12,7095,It ’ s 8357688 8 .,N
13,7095,"Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now .",N
14,7095,You ’ re welcome . __eou__,N
0,7096,"Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home !",Y
1,7096,Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ?,N
2,7096,What do you mean ?,N
3,7096,"I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet .",N
4,7096,But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money .,Y
5,7096,Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ?,N
6,7096,Pyramid scheme ? What is that ?,N
7,7096,"It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .",N
8,7096,Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him .,Y
9,7096,"Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom .",Y
10,7096,What happens then ?,N
11,7096,"Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam .",N
12,7096,"I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . __eou__",Y
0,7097,"Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week .",N
1,7097,We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ?,N
2,7097,"It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .",N
3,7097,What happened ?,N
4,7097,"Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person .",Y
5,7097,"Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work !",N
6,7097,"I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us .",Y
7,7097,"Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ?",Y
8,7097,What is that ?,N
9,7097,A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper .,Y
10,7097,"I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? __eou__",N
0,7098,Who ’ s that ?,N
1,7098,It ’ me . Susan Taylor,N
2,7098,"Oh , please come in . nice to see you .",N
3,7098,"On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee .",N
4,7098,"Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house .",Y
5,7098,"Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done .",N
6,7098,But actually it ’ s not done yet . I ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp .,Y
7,7098,"That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ?",Y
8,7098,It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . __eou__,Y
0,7099,I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs .,N
1,7099,"That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market .",N
2,7099,What kind of house is it ?,N
3,7099,It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style .,Y
4,7099,"Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses .",Y
5,7099,And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price .,Y
6,7099,"Great , is it a two bedroom house ?",N
7,7099,"No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage .",N
8,7099,That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you .,N
9,7099,"Yeas , when will you buy a house ?",N
10,7099,"Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding .",Y
11,7099,"Right , congratulations .",N
12,7099,Thank you . __eou__,N
0,7100,Did you move into your new apartment ?,N
1,7100,"Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet .",N
2,7100,Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized .,N
3,7100,Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it .,N
4,7100,Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?,Y
5,7100,"Unfortunately , yes .",N
6,7100,What do you mean by that ?,N
7,7100,I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes .,N
8,7100,"Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent .",Y
9,7100,"I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure .",Y
10,7100,Is there a supermarket nearby ?,N
11,7100,"Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket .",N
12,7100,Sounds like you better buy a bicycle .,N
13,7100,"That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . __eou__",Y
0,7101,Can you believe the headlines ?,N
1,7101,What are you reading ?,N
2,7101,"I'm reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King .",Y
3,7101,"Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ?",N
4,7101,He got arrested all right .,N
5,7101,"If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .",N
6,7101,"Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .",N
7,7101,"I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire .",Y
8,7101,That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .,N
9,7101,I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .,Y
10,7101,"Yup , you got it . Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves .",N
11,7101,So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ?,N
12,7101,He's giving lectures on business at colleges . __eou__,Y
0,7102,"So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ?",N
1,7102,"No , not really . Why do you ask ?",N
2,7102,Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost .,N
3,7102,You saw a ghost ? When ?,Y
4,7102,"It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ...",N
5,7102,So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ?,N
6,7102,"It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ...",Y
7,7102,So what did you do ?,N
8,7102,"I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ...",N
9,7102,Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ?,N
10,7102,"It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . __eou__",N
0,7103,You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?,N
1,7103,"Yeah , about .",N
2,7103,Do you know Chinese better now ?,N
3,7103,"Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .",N
4,7103,"Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .",Y
5,7103,"I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .",Y
6,7103,A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .,N
7,7103,I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .,N
8,7103,"Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .",Y
9,7103,"Yes , absolutely true . __eou__",N
0,7104,So do you believe in palmistry ?,N
1,7104,Palmistry ? What is that ?,Y
2,7104,It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .,N
3,7104,"Oh , you mean palm reading . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it .",N
4,7104,Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ?,N
5,7104,"Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to .",Y
6,7104,"Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ...",Y
7,7104,What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ?,N
8,7104,"Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ...",N
9,7104,What ? What is it ? What's the matter ?,N
10,7104,You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . __eou__,N
0,7105,"Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?",N
1,7105,"Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total .",N
2,7105,"Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over .",N
3,7105,But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !,N
4,7105,Why can't we ?,Y
5,7105,"It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ?",Y
6,7105,"I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon .",N
7,7105,But we can't have thirteen for dinner !,N
8,7105,I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything .,N
9,7105,Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !,N
10,7105,"Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner .",Y
11,7105,That's better . __eou__,N
0,7106,Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ?,N
1,7106,"Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows .",Y
2,7106,"Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me .",N
3,7106,It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it .,Y
4,7106,"Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions .",Y
5,7106,Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch .,Y
6,7106,"She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it !",N
7,7106,She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . __eou__,N
0,7107,What a great weekend that was !,N
1,7107,My feelings exactly .,N
2,7107,I really enjoy the beach in the summer .,N
3,7107,I couldn't agree with you more .,N
4,7107,We should come here more often .,Y
5,7107,You are absolutely right .,N
6,7107,I'd like to come back next weekend .,N
7,7107,That's exactly the way I feel . __eou__,N
0,7108,Have you heard about Anlesen David ?,N
1,7108,"No , have they have another fight ?",N
2,7108,"No , they got engaged .",N
3,7108,You must be joking.Those two .,N
4,7108,"Well , my dear . I didn't believe either.But got it straight form the horse's mouth.Davi called me this morning .",N
5,7108,So when did this happen ?,N
6,7108,"Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip .",N
7,7108,"Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ?",N
8,7108,Next june .,N
9,7108,I can hardly believe it . __eou__,N
0,7109,"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance .",N
1,7109,"John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom .",N
2,7109,"I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning .",N
3,7109,Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ?,N
4,7109,"Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight .",N
5,7109,I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families .,Y
6,7109,I think you ’ re right ! __eou__,N
0,7110,"What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good .",N
1,7110,I just found out that my husband is cheating on me .,N
2,7110,You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy .,N
3,7110,That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months .,N
4,7110,Two months ? How did you find out ?,N
5,7110,"I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately .",N
6,7110,So you asked him about the girl who called ?,N
7,7110,"Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it .",N

2,7161,What's it like to work with her ?,N
3,7161,"She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight .",Y
4,7161,Tell me about it .,N
5,7161,"You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves .",N
6,7161,Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . __eou__,N
0,7162,Your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million .,Y
1,7162,"I need to be motivated , Vince.Multi - motivated . As in multi-million .",Y
2,7162,What if I said no ?,N
3,7162,Ever hear of WebTracker ?,Y
4,7162,"You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing .",N
5,7162,"I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich .",Y
6,7162,"OK . If you sign the Stars.com account before WebTracker does , we'll talk next week . __eou__",N
0,7163,I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action .,Y
1,7163,"She means business , for sure .",N
2,7163,Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception .,N
3,7163,We'd better get back to work .,N
4,7163,"Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... __eou__",N
0,7164,"It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am .",N
1,7164,No kidding . Time is running out .,N
2,7164,It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters .,Y
3,7164,Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through .,N
4,7164,Do you think we'll make it ?,N
5,7164,"I guess we'll either make it , or we won't . __eou__",Y
0,7165,Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ?,Y
1,7165,"No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ?",N
2,7165,I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ?,N
3,7165,"He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions .",N
4,7165,"A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . __eou__",Y
0,7166,"Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ?",N
1,7166,As long as it doesn't take too long .,N
2,7166,My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him .,N
3,7166,Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?,N
4,7166,"He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't .",N
5,7166,So what's the problem ? __eou__,N
0,7167,"Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime .",N
1,7167,And it's all coming down to the next three weeks .,N
2,7167,The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina .,N
3,7167,"Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ?",N
4,7167,Failure just isn't an option for her . I'm glad she's on our team . __eou__,N
0,7168,"OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ?",Y
1,7168,"I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney .",N
2,7168,Mm-hm . How long were you there ?,N
3,7168,I was there for almost a year .,N
4,7168,"Oh , OK .",N
5,7168,"And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .",closed
6,7168,"So , did you , did you lose your finger ?",N
7,7168,Almost .,N
8,7168,"Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .",Y
9,7168,Exactly .,N
10,7168,Will you be going back to Australia soon ?,N
11,7168,I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . __eou__,Y
0,7169,Hello Michael .,N
1,7169,Hello Todd .,N
2,7169,We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ?,N
3,7169,"Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty .",N
4,7169,OK . What are the biggest cities ?,N
5,7169,"The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself .",N
6,7169,"OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ?",N
7,7169,"I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine .",Y
8,7169,"Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ?",N
9,7169,"Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . __eou__",Y
0,7170,"Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower .",Y
1,7170,What's another Japanese art ?,Y
2,7170,"Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony !",Y
3,7170,Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony .,Y
4,7170,"Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl .",Y
5,7170,I see .,N
6,7170,"Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl",Y
7,7170,How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ?,Y
8,7170,"There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . __eou__",Y
0,7171,"OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy .",N
1,7171,"Well , thank you .",N
2,7171,What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ?,Y
3,7171,"Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained .",Y
4,7171,"Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot .",N
5,7171,Do ya ?,N
6,7171,"Yeah , so maybe it's my diet .",Y
7,7171,"It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars .",Y
8,7171,That's pretty tough ! __eou__,N
0,7172,Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person !,N
1,7172,"Hello sir . Good to meet you , too .",N
2,7172,"Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason .",N
3,7172,"Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ?",N
4,7172,Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night !,N
5,7172,Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ?,N
6,7172,The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason .,N
7,7172,That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ?,N
8,7172,Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway .,N
9,7172,"So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ?",Y
10,7172,I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall .,Y
11,7172,That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive . __eou__,Y
0,7173,So will you come to work with us ?,N
1,7173,Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ?,Y
2,7173,We'll have to negotiate that . It's a possibility .,Y
3,7173,"You miss me , don't you ?",N
4,7173,"Don't push your luck , Dave .",N
5,7173,"OK , I'm in . When do I start ?",Y
6,7173,As soon as you can get here . We'll be waiting for you . __eou__,N
0,7174,"I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ...",N
1,7174,"and what if it doesn't work out , right ?",N
2,7174,Exactly .,N
3,7174,You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?,N
4,7174,How ?,N
5,7174,Because I won't let it fail .,N
6,7174,"But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? __eou__",Y
0,7175,"Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ?",N
1,7175,"Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest .",N
2,7175,"Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?",N
3,7175,Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited !,Y
4,7175,I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want .,Y
5,7175,"Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ?",N
6,7175,"Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price .",Y
7,7175,Cool ! Teach me !,Y
8,7175,"For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost .",Y
9,7175,"Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else .",Y
10,7175,That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . __eou__,Y
0,7176,"OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see !",Y
1,7176,"Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London .",Y
2,7176,OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ?,N
3,7176,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities .",Y
4,7176,"Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ?",N
5,7176,"Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound .",N
6,7176,"Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ?",Y
7,7176,"Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go !",Y
8,7176,Is that how you feel on the bus ?,N
9,7176,"Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time .",N
10,7176,"So , so you're British , do you missing them ?",N
11,7176,"Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . __eou__",N
0,7177,This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city .,Y
1,7177,"Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ?",Y
2,7177,"I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon .",N
3,7177,That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels .,Y
4,7177,I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that .,Y
5,7177,And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ?,N
6,7177,Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled .,Y
7,7177,Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . __eou__,Y
0,7178,"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !",N
1,7178,"Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?",N
2,7178,"Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .",Y
3,7178,Can't Elvin handle it ?,N
4,7178,I think he's got too much on his plate . __eou__,N
0,7179,Yeah . You don't need to rub it in .,N
1,7179,And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ...,N
2,7179,Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ?,N
3,7179,That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her .,N
4,7179,"Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now .",Y
5,7179,"You really should have stayed with us , Dave . __eou__",N
0,7180,That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing .,N
1,7180,"Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ?",N
2,7180,You can say that again !,N
3,7180,What's up with Vince and Elvin ?,N
4,7180,They work for Zina now .,N
5,7180,And they're happy with that ?,N
6,7180,They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . __eou__,N
0,7181,"This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move .",Y
1,7181,You do ?,N
2,7181,"Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too .",N
3,7181,No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together !,Y
4,7181,"Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck .",Y
5,7181,No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil !,N
6,7181,"It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . __eou__",Y
0,7182,"Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker !",N
1,7182,"Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ?",N
2,7182,I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ?,N
3,7182,"Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ?",N
4,7182,That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ?,N
5,7182,I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . __eou__,N
0,7183,"Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ?",N
1,7183,I don ’ t know .,N

4,7183,"Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it .",N
5,7183,"It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend .",Y
6,7183,"Ur , you really let me down .",N
7,7183,Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory .,N
8,7183,"No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband .",N
9,7183,What day is it on earth ?,N
10,7183,It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . __eou__,Y
0,7184,Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ?,N
1,7184,He has no sense .,N
2,7184,"If I were him , I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money .",Y
3,7184,But Joe won't you . __eou__,N
0,7185,"Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job .",N
1,7185,"I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too .",Y
2,7185,"You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__",N
0,7186,Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ?,N
1,7186,I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act .,Y
2,7186,He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves .,Y
3,7186,"But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . __eou__",Y
0,7187,My son came home from three years in the navy .,N
1,7187,It was a real red letter day for you .,N
2,7187,Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . __eou__,N
0,7188,Susan is going to get a divorce .,N

2,7188,"She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .",N
3,7188,"Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . __eou__",N
0,7189,"Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance .",N
1,7189,"Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross .",Y
2,7189,That's really a good thing . Let's do our part .,Y
3,7189,Good idea .,Y
4,7189,Who will sing in the show ?,N
5,7189,"A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ...",Y
6,7189,Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs !,N
7,7189,Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself .,Y
8,7189,"Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile .",N
9,7189,She is a real star . Not a onetime thing .,Y
10,7189,But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing !,Y
11,7189,"Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things .",Y
12,7189,"You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her .",Y
13,7189,Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ?,N
14,7189,Here is the programme . Check it out yourself !,N
15,7189,OK . __eou__,N
0,7190,"Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God .",N
1,7190,Do you really think so ?,N
2,7190,"Yeah , you have some other ideas ?",Y
3,7190,"Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us .",Y
4,7190,For example ?,N
5,7190,"We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air .",Y
6,7190,"Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__",Y
0,7191,John dates her seven times a week .,N
1,7191,Really ? That's a straws in the wind .,Y

2,7192,Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too .,Y
3,7192,It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied .,N
4,7192,"Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff .",Y
5,7192,Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine .,Y
6,7192,"Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ?",N
7,7192,No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch .,N
8,7192,But you didn't eat anything today .,N
9,7192,"Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant .",N
10,7192,All right . I'm going to the McDonald's .,N
11,7192,For what ? I thought you didn't like western food .,N
12,7192,"No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week .",N
13,7192,"That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food .",N
14,7192,"Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one .",Y
15,7192,That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . __eou__,N
0,7193,Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women .,N
1,7193,That's fate .,N

0,7194,How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?,N
1,7194,We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .,Y
2,7194,Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .,Y
3,7194,But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . __eou__,N
0,7195,"Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?",N

9,7195,Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?,N
10,7195,"That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .",Y
11,7195,Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .,Y
12,7195,Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__,N
0,7196,Do you have any hobbies ?,N
1,7196,"Yes , I like collecting things .",N

0,7239,"Mom , I've got something to tell you .",N
1,7239,"So , please !",N
2,7239,Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs .,N
3,7239,I bought you a new one last year . Isn't it handsome ?,N
4,7239,It is great . But Tom's bike is so much better than mine .,N
5,7239,"Frankly , he is more well-behaved than you .",N
6,7239,Nothing of that sort !,N
7,7239,Why hasn't the bus come yet ? Every morning we have to wait for so long .,N
8,7239,"Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus .",Y
9,7239,Really ? I am looking forward to that . What about the traffic ?,N
10,7239,Let me see.Yes . I will buy a plane for you . There is no traffic up there . __eou__,Y

5,7240,My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ?,Y
6,7240,I'm a back-packer from America .,N
7,7240,What is a back-packer ?,Y
8,7240,It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world .,Y
9,7240,Cool . You must have been to a lot of places .,N
10,7240,"Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places .",N
11,7240,So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up .,Y
12,7240,You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier .,N
13,7240,I'll try my best . __eou__,N
0,7241,You look great !,N
1,7241,Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up .,N
2,7241,So you are happy that you made the decision to join us .,N
3,7241,I surely am . But still there is one single problem .,Y
4,7241,What's that ?,N
5,7241,I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me .,N
6,7241,It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ?,Y
7,7241,I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ?,Y
8,7241,More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ?,Y
9,7241,Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ?,N
10,7241,Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master .,Y
11,7241,I can so that .,N
12,7241,Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them .,Y
13,7241,How did it go ?,N
14,7241,"Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . __eou__",N
0,7242,"Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before .",N
1,7242,"Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card .",N
2,7242,Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever .,N
3,7242,It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market .,Y
4,7242,"It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ?",N
5,7242,"Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ?",Y
6,7242,"That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up .",N
7,7242,I am still young . And I'm growing every minute .,Y
8,7242,Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope .,Y
9,7242,I love running . Anything else ?,N
10,7242,Please change your clothes first !,N
11,7242,I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me .,N
12,7242,"Sorry , but no jeans here .",N
13,7242,"Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . __eou__",N
0,7243,"Mom , this is your third bowl of rice !",N
1,7243,I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more .,N
2,7243,Why ? I never saw you eat so much before .,N
3,7243,I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time .,N
4,7243,So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out .,N
5,7243,Don't pull my leg .,N
6,7243,This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ?,N
7,7243,Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now .,Y
8,7243,Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ?,Y
9,7243,I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed .,N
10,7243,"Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise .",Y
11,7243,Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself .,N
12,7243,"He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy .",Y
13,7243,"Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato .",Y
14,7243,Who knows ! __eou__,Y
0,7244,"Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere .",N
1,7244,"Come on , just a little piece .",N
2,7244,Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ?,N
3,7244,I have no idea .,N
4,7244,"Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day .",Y
5,7244,That's amazing .,N
6,7244,"If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can .",Y
7,7244,"Come on , you are making too big deal out of this .",N
8,7244,I just want to remind you to behave yourself .,N
9,7244,"OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again . __eou__",N
0,7245,Come back . You haven't paid yet .,N
1,7245,"May , just let him go .",N
2,7245,But he took some newspaper away without paying .,N
3,7245,I know .,N
4,7245,Why ? You make me confused .,N
5,7245,"He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later .",Y
6,7245,Why does he have such a privilege ?,N
7,7245,He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him .,N
8,7245,I see . Does he live by himself ?,N
9,7245,"Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle .",N
10,7245,He must be lonely ?,N
11,7245,I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories .,Y
12,7245,How respectable ! __eou__,N
0,7246,"Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?",N
1,7246,"Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .",N
2,7246,"May , I really regret watching it with you last night .",N
3,7246,Did it scare you ?,N
4,7246,Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .,N
5,7246,"Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .",N
6,7246,"Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .",N
7,7246,I like scary movies .,N
8,7246,That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !,Y
9,7246,Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .,N
10,7246,Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .,N
11,7246,Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?,N
12,7246,Of course ! I can watch them without you !,Y
13,7246,"Oh , really ? __eou__",N
0,7247,Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ?,N
1,7247,Yes . What a good job we have done !,N
2,7247,Why are so many extra gifts left here ?,N
3,7247,Many customers didn't want them .,N
4,7247,How about giving them to that old man ?,Y
5,7247,Good idea .,Y
6,7247,"By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ?",Y
7,7247,"I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today .",Y
8,7247,I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper .,Y
9,7247,But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around .,N
10,7247,That's true .,N
11,7247,"Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home .",N
12,7247,Okay . How tiring the job is ! __eou__,N
0,7248,What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you .,Y
1,7248,"Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time .",N
2,7248,"Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money .",Y
3,7248,"Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money .",Y
4,7248,"It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it .",Y
5,7248,"Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well .",N
6,7248,"Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ?",N
7,7248,"No , but tell me some . I am interested .",Y
8,7248,Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition .,Y
9,7248,Are there many people there ? Do you think people actually like them ?,N
10,7248,"I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train .",Y
11,7248,But I still prefer the pop music in the subway .,N
12,7248,"Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values .",Y
13,7248,"Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ?",N
14,7248,"Not well enough , but I'm learning . __eou__",N
0,7249,"I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up .",N
1,7249,Don't be scared.Bite the bullet and everything will be right again .,N
2,7249,Thank you for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will over come them one by one . __eou__,Y
0,7250,He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means .,N
1,7250,How did he make a fortune ?,N
2,7250,He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . __eou__,N
0,7251,I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again .,N
1,7251,"Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier .",N
2,7251,You'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag .,N
3,7251,I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__,N
0,7252,"Whatever we do , we should do it above board .",N
1,7252,You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .,N
2,7252,"Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . __eou__",Y
0,7253,Do you know Sally ?,N
1,7253,Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .,Y
2,7253,Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .,N
3,7253,"Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . __eou__",Y
0,7254,Why did Tom quit the job ?,N
1,7254,He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley .,N
2,7254,"If he doesn't change his attitude toward his work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . __eou__",N
0,7255,Do you think you'll get the project ?,N
1,7255,It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it .,Y
2,7255,"I see.After all , he's boss's son .",N
3,7255,"But anyway , I'll have a try . __eou__",Y
0,7256,What's his job ?,N
1,7256,He used to be a policeman .,N
2,7256,But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son .,N
3,7256,Yeah . He's a private eye now . __eou__,N
0,7257,He has a girlfriend already .,N
1,7257,You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann .,N
2,7257,Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air .,Y
3,7257,I hope I will meet her soon . __eou__,N
0,7258,John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot .,Y
1,7258,I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder .,N
2,7258,What is your idea ?,Y
3,7258,Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . __eou__,Y
0,7259,Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .,N
1,7259,Why doesn't he ask her ?,N
2,7259,He is too scared to ask her .,N
3,7259,He's a chicken guy . __eou__,N
0,7260,I wonder how Sarah and Mat are .,Y
1,7260,Don't you know they've already broken up ?,N
2,7260,I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane .,N
3,7260,And he's so handsome . __eou__,N
0,7261,Doesn't she have any friends ?,N
1,7261,"If she has , they must be fair-weather friends .",N
2,7261,Such friends are even worse than enemies .,N
3,7261,She'd better keep away from them . __eou__,N
0,7262,Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation .,N
1,7262,I really couldn't understand him .,N
2,7262,"He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him .",N
3,7262,We'd better leave him alone . __eou__,N
0,7263,Have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ?,Y
1,7263,I am always on the look out for such girls .,N
2,7263,I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them .,N

0,7265,I decided to go for this kind of life .,Y
1,7265,Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take .,Y
2,7265,I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .,Y
3,7265,Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__,N

2,7267,"You know , honey , I used it all on the way over .",N
3,7267,I think I'm getting a heart stroke .,N
4,7267,The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat .,N
5,7267,"Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you .",N

6,7268,No . But now he will be in bigger trouble ! What's a boyfriend for ? Forget about Valentine's Day ?,Y
7,7268,Poor guy ! It's not fair . You forgot it too .,N
8,7268,"Oh , it's Clive .",N
9,7268,Wow ! Good timing .,N

5,7269,"Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here .",Y
6,7269,"This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere .",Y

6,7270,"Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement .",Y
7,7270,Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now .,Y
8,7270,Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer .,N
9,7270,That is not true . They are just jealous of him !,N
10,7270,"Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart .",Y

12,7270,"By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ?",N

8,7271,Thay are coming back to narrow the gap .,N
9,7271,"Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer .",N
10,7271,A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now .,N
11,7271,Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open .,N
12,7271,"Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk !",N
13,7271,"Good that he resembled his old , quick self . __eou__",N

7,7272,"Aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating ...",Y
8,7272,Interesting . What were you reading just now ?,N

1,7273,The same question to you .,N
2,7273,"Well , we shall make it a secret between us .",Y
3,7273,"Deal , Where is Gucci ?",N
4,7273,She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come .,N
5,7273,"Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA .",N

8,7273,"Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that .",N

2,7274,You just need more exercise .,N
3,7274,"Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !",N
4,7274,I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .,N
5,7274,But running so fast is not good for people over forties .,N
6,7274,Why ?,N
7,7274,We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .,Y
8,7274,But I want to burn up more calories !,Y
9,7274,"In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .",Y
10,7274,Really ? I will slow down then . __eou__,N
0,7275,"Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle .",N
1,7275,"Oh , my god , are you OK ?",N
2,7275,Of course not !,N
3,7275,"Come on , sit down , and let me have a look .",N
4,7275,The pain is killing me .,N
5,7275,I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen .,N
6,7275,I thought leather shoes will do just as well .,Y
7,7275,"Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that .",N
8,7275,What are you going to do ?,N
9,7275,"I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ?",Y
10,7275,God ! It's freezing !,N
11,7275,Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . __eou__,N
0,7276,"Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ?",N
1,7276,I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse .,Y
2,7276,I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ?,N
3,7276,"I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life .",Y
4,7276,I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ?,N
5,7276,Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it .,N
6,7276,All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?,N
7,7276,"Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .",N
8,7276,"I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .",Y
9,7276,Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ?,N
10,7276,Which country makes the best coffee in the world ?,N
11,7276,Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .,Y
12,7276,"I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?",N
13,7276,"Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .",Y
14,7276,"No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .",N
15,7276,I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . __eou__,Y
0,7277,"Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ?",N
1,7277,Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality .,Y
2,7277,"Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each .",Y
3,7277,"What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ?",Y
4,7277,We should choose from the backups .,Y
5,7277,That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match .,N
6,7277,"That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle .",Y
7,7277,"That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played .",Y
8,7277,"Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ?",N
9,7277,I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before .,Y
10,7277,"Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic .",N
11,7277,"Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ?",N
12,7277,"Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding .",N
13,7277,Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ?,N
14,7277,"Yeah , what ’ s up ?",N
15,7277,Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ?,N
16,7277,"I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . __eou__",N
0,7278,"Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more .",N
1,7278,"Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me !",Y
2,7278,"OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke .",N
3,7278,"Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out .",N
4,7278,"Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned .",N
5,7278,"Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly .",N
6,7278,"Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming .",N
7,7278,"Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough .",N
8,7278,"Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong .",N
9,7278,"Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it .",N
10,7278,Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart .,Y
11,7278,"Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head .",N
12,7278,"Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ?",Y
13,7278,"That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . __eou__",Y
0,7279,"Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ?",N
1,7279,"To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here .",Y
2,7279,"The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else .",N
3,7279,"Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ?",N
4,7279,"Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game .",N
5,7279,Who plays who ?,N
6,7279,"Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .",Y
7,7279,It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ?,N
8,7279,In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever .,N
9,7279,I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall .,N
10,7279,"Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful .",Y
11,7279,I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .,Y
12,7279,"Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .",N
13,7279,"That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy .",N
14,7279,"Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ?",N
15,7279,You are always so naughty . __eou__,N
0,7280,"Hey , Daniel , how's it going ?",N
1,7280,"Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class .",N
2,7280,"Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?",N
3,7280,We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator .,Y
4,7280,Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?,N
5,7280,"Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa .",Y
6,7280,"Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?",N
7,7280,"Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty .",N
8,7280,"Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?",N
9,7280,"Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do .",N
10,7280,"You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .",Y
11,7280,"OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .",N
12,7280,"That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?",N
13,7280,"Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?",Y
14,7280,"Exactly , now , tell me the time .",N
15,7280,"I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . __eou__",N
0,7281,"Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water .",N
1,7281,I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation .,N
2,7281,"Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has .",Y
3,7281,"OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ?",N
4,7281,"As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long .",N
5,7281,That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming .,N
6,7281,Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ?,N
7,7281,"Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that .",Y
8,7281,Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ?,N
9,7281,"Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . __eou__",N

3,7282,"Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time .",Y
4,7282,My children would like that ; they like dancing very much .,N
5,7282,That's good !,N
6,7282,Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ?,N
7,7282,"Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin .",N
8,7282,Really ?,N
9,7282,"He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself .",N
10,7282,He performs very well . He is so funny !,N
11,7282,"OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family !",Y
12,7282,"OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ?",N
13,7282,"Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour .",Y

6,7283,"Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me .",Y
7,7283,"I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before .",N
8,7283,"Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong .",N
9,7283,Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ?,N
10,7283,Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to .,N

0,7284,"Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .",N
1,7284,"Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .",Y
2,7284,And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .,Y
3,7284,"Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .",Y
4,7284,There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .,N
5,7284,"That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .",N
6,7284,"Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .",Y
7,7284,"My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .",N
8,7284,"OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .",N
9,7284,"Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . __eou__",N
0,7285,"I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working .",N
1,7285,He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep .,N
2,7285,"If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__",N
0,7286,"Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great .",N
1,7286,Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane .,N
2,7286,"No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag .",N
3,7286,"Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .",N
4,7286,"Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ?",N
5,7286,"Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most .",Y
6,7286,All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World .,N
7,7286,Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty .,N
8,7286,"No , before the In dynasty .",N
9,7286,"Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well .",Y
10,7286,Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . __eou__,Y
0,7287,Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?,N
1,7287,"Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?",N
2,7287,Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .,Y
3,7287,"That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .",Y
4,7287,Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?,N
5,7287,"When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .",Y
6,7287,"I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?",N
7,7287,"Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .",Y
8,7287,Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .,N
9,7287,"Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .",Y

3,7288,"News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on .",Y
4,7288,Is there anything interesting ?,N
5,7288,"Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education .",Y
6,7288,I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ?,N
7,7288,Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .,Y
8,7288,That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ?,N
9,7288,Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .,N
10,7288,I got it . Do you pay for the programs ?,N
11,7288,"Yes , 50 Yuan per month . __eou__",N
0,7289,Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday .,N
1,7289,This must be his 21st birthday . No doubt about it .,N
2,7289,Why ? Do you know that guy ?,N
3,7289,"No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars .",N
4,7289,"That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks .",Y
5,7289,"No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything .",Y
6,7289,Wow . That's wonderful .,N
7,7289,What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ?,N
8,7289,"Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . __eou__",Y

2,7290,"Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ?",N
3,7290,"You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too .",Y
4,7290,Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ?,N
5,7290,"I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players .",Y
6,7290,"Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . __eou__",N
0,7291,"May , is the university a terrible place ?",N
1,7291,Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ?,Y
2,7291,Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in .,Y
3,7291,"Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think .",Y
4,7291,How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet .,N
5,7291,"Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom .",N
6,7291,"Oh , really ? Were you not caught ?",N
7,7291,"Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment .",Y
8,7291,What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ?,Y
9,7291,"This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect .",Y
10,7291,"I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English .",N
11,7291,"Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make .",Y
12,7291,You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form .,Y
13,7291,Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . __eou__,N
0,7292,"Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name .",Y

2,7292,What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there .,N
3,7292,Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?,Y
4,7292,Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ?,N
5,7292,They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival .,Y
6,7292,"Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it .",Y
7,7292,It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life .,N
8,7292,"Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth .",N
9,7292,Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter .,Y
10,7292,"There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ?",Y
11,7292,"Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene . __eou__",N

6,7293,"3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep .",N
7,7293,"I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it .",N
8,7293,I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair .,Y
9,7293,"Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it .",Y
10,7293,"Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs",Y

4,7294,"Of course , Bamboo !",Y
5,7294,That's right .,N
6,7294,I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship .,Y

4,7295,"There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting .",N
5,7295,Special rules ?,N
6,7295,"There , you only have two ways for visiting .",N
7,7295,Details ?,N
8,7295,"On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region .",N
9,7295,Why not ?,Y
10,7295,Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be .,Y
11,7295,That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ?,N

0,7301,Do you believe in UFOs ?,N
1,7301,"Of course , they are out there .",Y
2,7301,But I never saw them .,N
3,7301,"Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .",N
4,7301,You mean that you can them .,N
5,7301,That's right . I can see them in my dreams .,N
6,7301,They come to the earth ?,N
7,7301,No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .,N
8,7301,Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?,Y

2,7307,I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__,N
0,7308,They got a divorce at last .,N
1,7308,"It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .",Y
2,7308,You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .,N
3,7308,That give us a good lesson . __eou__,N
0,7309,What will happen to the children if you break up ?,N
1,7309,That's a relief for me and a misery for the children .,N
2,7309,Why don't you make up with John .,N
3,7309,It's too late . __eou__,N
0,7310,It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy .,N
1,7310,Are you sure of that ?,N
2,7310,I am not certain about that .,N
3,7310,They may have some difficulty in doing it . __eou__,N
0,7311,"Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ?",N
1,7311,"Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think .",N
2,7311,Really ?,N
3,7311,Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . __eou__,N
0,7312,"You seem to like her very much , don't you ?",N
1,7312,I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her .,N
2,7312,But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl .,N
3,7312,I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . __eou__,N
0,7313,May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law .,N
1,7313,Yeah . That's just what is troubling John .,N
2,7313,Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread .,N

0,7314,Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere .,N
1,7314,Haven't you heard that he is in prison ?,N
2,7314,What ? Beg your pardon .,N
3,7314,John is in prison now . He was copped outstealing .,N

3,7315,He deserved it . __eou__,N
0,7316,What will you do now ? Propose to her .,Y
1,7316,Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once .,Y
2,7316,You should strike while the iron is hot .,Y
3,7316,You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . __eou__,N
0,7317,Does Tom drink a lot ?,N
1,7317,"Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .",N
2,7317,That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . __eou__,N
0,7318,What did her boss say to you ?,N
1,7318,He asked me to beef up in the work .,N
2,7318,Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter .,Y

0,7320,You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ?,N
1,7320,Yeah .,N
2,7320,Are you sure ?,N
3,7320,Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .,N
4,7320,Just because he gets on well with everybody ?,Y
5,7320,"Partly , and he's also a hard working man . __eou__",N
0,7321,You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?,N
1,7321,I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .,N
2,7321,Where did you spend your holiday ?,N
3,7321,I went to Paris . __eou__,N
0,7322,To be a revolutionary needs great courage !,Y

1,7325,Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush .,N
2,7325,Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ?,N

4,7327,"You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock .",N
5,7327,Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two .,Y
6,7327,Thanks for telling me this .,N
7,7327,"I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying .",N
8,7327,"Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again .",N

5,7328,"Actually , I'd forgotten about it .",N
6,7328,Forgotten about it ? How could you ?,N
7,7328,"Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish .",N
8,7328,"Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know .",N
9,7328,It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian .,N
10,7328,I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ?,N
11,7328,"Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break .",N

6,7330,I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .,N
7,7330,"Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive .",Y
8,7330,How much do you make ?,N
9,7330,"I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__",Y

3,7331,"Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church .",Y
4,7331,Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ?,N
5,7331,"That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all .",Y
6,7331,Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ?,N
7,7331,Yes .,N
8,7331,Why do you really go to church ?,N
9,7331,"We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . __eou__",Y
0,7332,"Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?",N

1,7336,She is now in a private school .,N
2,7336,"Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school .",N
3,7336,It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools .,Y
4,7336,But the private school amount to better schools . __eou__,Y
0,7337,A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine .,N
1,7337,That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him .,N

5,7356,"It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend .",Y
6,7356,"Ur , you really let me down .",N
7,7356,Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory .,N
8,7356,"No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband .",N
9,7356,What day is it on earth ?,N
10,7356,It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . __eou__,Y
0,7357,What's the date today Mr.Brown ? I don't have a calendar .,N

9,7357,You won't be late . It's still early . __eou__,N
0,7358,Do I need a visa ?,N
1,7358,"No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course .",N
2,7358,"Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency .",N
3,7358,"Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them .",Y
4,7358,"Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing .",N
5,7358,You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine .,Y
6,7358,"That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long .",N
7,7358,"Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . __eou__",Y
0,7359,That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up .,N
1,7359,It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .,N
2,7359,"I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?",N
3,7359,"I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .",N
4,7359,I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .,N
5,7359,"Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks .",Y
6,7359,"Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too .",N
7,7359,"Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious .",N
8,7359,I think that she had a litter too much of the punch .,N
9,7359,"What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong .",Y
10,7359,That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ?,N
11,7359,"Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves .",N
12,7359,"That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ?",N
13,7359,All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? __eou__,N
0,7360,You know John ?,N
1,7360,Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ?,N
2,7360,Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper .,N
3,7360,And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam .,N
4,7360,I wish he could too .,N
5,7360,"How ’ s your boy , Jack ?",N
6,7360,"He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .",N
7,7360,"Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ?",N
8,7360,Good luck to them . __eou__,N
0,7361,"There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs .",Y
1,7361,I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans .,Y
2,7361,I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more .,Y
3,7361,"I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying .",Y
4,7361,I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway .,N
5,7361,"Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign .",Y
6,7361,"I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something .",Y
7,7361,That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . __eou__,Y
0,7362,What ’ s your working day like ?,N
1,7362,"I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days .",N
2,7362,Do you get paid onetime ?,N
3,7362,"No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients .",N
4,7362,Do you have any breaks ?,N
5,7362,"We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time .",Y
6,7362,"My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?",Y
7,7362,"There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ?",Y
8,7362,"Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much .",N
9,7362,"I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . __eou__",Y
0,7363,I ’ d love to have my own farm .,Y
1,7363,It would be very hard work . Are you sure ?,N
2,7363,I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy .,Y
3,7363,Running a farm would be totally different to you current job .,Y
4,7363,That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office .,Y
5,7363,You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into .,N
6,7363,My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .,Y
7,7363,"Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . __eou__",Y
0,7364,What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ?,N
1,7364,"I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ?",Y
2,7364,I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv .,Y
3,7364,I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence .,N
4,7364,Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !,Y
5,7364,Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs .,Y
6,7364,"In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour .",Y
7,7364,That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?,N
8,7364,No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ?,N
9,7364,"Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month .",Y
10,7364,"Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .",Y
11,7364,"Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? __eou__",Y
0,7365,What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ?,Y
1,7365,"Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high .",Y
2,7365,"So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?",N
3,7365,"No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs .",N
4,7365,How can a business maximise revenues ?,Y
5,7365,You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small .,Y
6,7365,What else do you suggest ?,Y
7,7365,"Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . __eou__",Y
0,7366,What ’ s your city like ?,Y
1,7366,"It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls .",Y
2,7366,Is the traffic bad in the city centre ?,N
3,7366,"Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good .",Y
4,7366,What about restaurants and entertainment ?,Y
5,7366,"There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey .",Y
6,7366,Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?,N
7,7366,"There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas .",Y
8,7366,It sounds like a really exciting city to live in .,Y
9,7366,"It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . __eou__",N
0,7367,Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world .,N
1,7367,I just don ’ t find it very interesting .,N
2,7367,I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .,Y
3,7367,"I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries .",Y
4,7367,I think the Olympics help to promote world peace .,Y
5,7367,"I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .",Y
6,7367,"You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .",Y
7,7367,Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics .,Y
8,7367,Now there we are in agreement ! __eou__,N
0,7368,"When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin .",Y
1,7368,Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus .,N
2,7368,"I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them !",N
3,7368,I thought you were good at the high jump !,N
4,7368,"No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best .",N
5,7368,Did you ever win any competitions ?,N
6,7368,"I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ?",Y
7,7368,"I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ?",N
8,7368,"Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . __eou__",N
0,7369,Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship .,N
1,7369,"Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events .",N
2,7369,"Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ?",N
3,7369,We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters .,N
4,7369,That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win .,N
5,7369,The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds .,N
6,7369,That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ?,N
7,7369,"A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place .",Y
8,7369,Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts .,N
9,7369,Was he disqualified ?,N
10,7369,"Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . __eou__",Y
0,7370,I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .,Y
1,7370,"I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .",Y
2,7370,The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .,Y
3,7370,Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .,Y
4,7370,Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .,Y
5,7370,Can you ride a horse ?,N
6,7370,"Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ?",N
7,7370,I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?,Y
8,7370,What a good idea ! __eou__,Y
0,7371,What are you doing ?,N
1,7371,I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class .,N
2,7371,There are no countries marked on the map .,N
3,7371,"No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .",N
4,7371,"The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .",Y
5,7371,I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .,Y
6,7371,Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon .,Y
7,7371,The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate .,Y
8,7371,It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . __eou__,Y
0,7372,Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ?,Y
1,7372,My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country .,Y
2,7372,Is it really completely flat ?,N
3,7372,"Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .",N
4,7372,"Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .",N
5,7372,The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches .,Y
6,7372,"That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them .",Y
7,7372,"There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes .",Y
8,7372,"We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . __eou__",Y
0,7373,What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?,Y
1,7373,"I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor .",Y
2,7373,Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops .,Y
3,7373,"What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet .",Y
4,7373,We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .,Y
5,7373,"That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals .",Y
6,7373,I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways .,Y
7,7373,I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced .,Y
8,7373,That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well .,N
9,7373,"Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare .",Y
10,7373,Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .,Y
11,7373,"Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . __eou__",N
0,7374,I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .,Y
1,7374,Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed .,N
2,7374,Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .,Y
3,7374,Is that type of plant found in this country ?,N
4,7374,"No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action .",N
5,7374,So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ?,Y
6,7374,"They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another .",Y
7,7374,"That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too .",Y
8,7374,That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .,N
9,7374,I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .,Y
10,7374,"According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .",Y
11,7374,"That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . __eou__",Y
0,7375,Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .,Y
1,7375,"Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?",N
2,7375,"Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ?",N
3,7375,"Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge .",N
4,7375,The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?,Y
5,7375,Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .,N
6,7375,"When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree .",Y
7,7375,"Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect .",Y
8,7375,Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . __eou__,N
0,7376,Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?,Y
1,7376,Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?,Y
2,7376,"First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .",N
3,7376,That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .,Y
4,7376,How do you research your books ?,Y
5,7376,I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .,Y
6,7376,I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !,N
7,7376,Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .,N
8,7376,Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?,Y
9,7376,"There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .",Y
10,7376,Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . __eou__,N
0,7377,which countries have you been to ?,N
1,7377,"I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada .",Y
2,7377,I thought you had been to Australia too .,N
3,7377,"no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ?",N
4,7377,"I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains .",Y
5,7377,isn ’ t it really cold there ?,N
6,7377,"well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter .",Y
7,7377,"I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . __eou__",Y
0,7378,Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ?,Y
1,7378,We need to talk about the size of the country and its population .,Y
2,7378,"Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population .",Y
3,7378,"It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population .",N
4,7378,We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ?,Y
5,7378,"We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year .",Y
6,7378,That sounds very general .,N
7,7378,"It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one .",Y
8,7378,"One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ?",Y
9,7378,"Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou .",Y
10,7378,We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? __eou__,Y
0,7379,"Hi , Mark ! Long time no see !",N
1,7379,"Hi , Alex !",N
2,7379,Where have you been ?,N
3,7379,I just got back from London .,N
4,7379,How was your flight ?,N
5,7379,"It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though .",N
6,7379,That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ?,N
7,7379,It was 10 hours .,N
8,7379,Did you have a layover ?,N
9,7379,"Yes , in Paris , France .",N
10,7379,Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ?,N
11,7379,Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you !,N
12,7379,"Oh , you didn ’ t have to ...",N
13,7379,It was nothing . __eou__,N
0,7380,What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ?,N
1,7380,"Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .",Y
2,7380,"In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?",Y
3,7380,"That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul .",N
4,7380,"I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?",Y
5,7380,"If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch .",Y
6,7380,"There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?",Y
7,7380,"Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football .",Y
8,7380,"The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?",Y
9,7380,Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching .,Y
10,7380,Ok . __eou__,N
0,7381,Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK .,N
1,7381,"Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .",N
2,7381,I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .,N
3,7381,"I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .",N
4,7381,It must have really hurt afterwards .,N
5,7381,"Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .",N
6,7381,I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .,N
7,7381,"I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !",N
8,7381,Is there any pain now ?,N
9,7381,"No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .",N
10,7381,Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?,N
11,7381,"Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . __eou__",N
0,7382,How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?,Y
1,7382,I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line .,Y
2,7382,I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .,Y
3,7382,"If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars .",Y
4,7382,How would you do that ?,N
5,7382,"I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much .",Y
6,7382,"I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example .",N
7,7382,I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes .,Y
8,7382,The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular .,Y
9,7382,"That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . __eou__",Y
0,7383,Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ?,N
1,7383,"Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery .",N
2,7383,"Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems .",N
3,7383,The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound .,N
4,7383,Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks .,N
5,7383,I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good .,N
6,7383,The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ?,N
7,7383,"It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive .",N
8,7383,His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . __eou__,N
0,7384,Is your city a historical place ?,N
1,7384,"Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village .",Y
2,7384,How did it grow into such a large place ?,Y
3,7384,Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre .,N
4,7384,"As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .",Y
5,7384,"Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city .",N
6,7384,I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?,N
7,7384,"Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too .",Y
8,7384,Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . __eou__,Y
0,7385,What ’ s your favourite ball sport ?,N
1,7385,I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV .,N
2,7385,Who ’ s your favourite player ?,N
3,7385,I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston .,N
4,7385,Do they have a good team ?,N
5,7385,"I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach .",Y
6,7385,I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing .,Y
7,7385,I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well .,Y
8,7385,"You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ?",N
9,7385,"Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table .",N
10,7385,How many more games are there this season ?,N
11,7385,We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . __eou__,N
0,7386,Hello ! How are you .,N
1,7386,Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days .,N
2,7386,What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ?,N
3,7386,That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted .,N
4,7386,Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job .,Y
5,7386,Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual .,Y
6,7386,Well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good .,N
7,7386,"Yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along .",N
8,7386,"OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . __eou__",N
0,7387,I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ?,N
1,7387,"Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .",Y
2,7387,"I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .",Y
3,7387,Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?,Y
4,7387,"I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .",Y
5,7387,You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?,Y
6,7387,"You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film "" .",Y
7,7387,It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . __eou__,Y
0,7388,"You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ?",N
1,7388,"Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol .",N
2,7388,How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ?,N
3,7388,"Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part .",Y
4,7388,I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him .,N
5,7388,Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .,Y
6,7388,Are you a member of his fan club ?,N
7,7388,"I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now .",N
8,7388,Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?,N
9,7388,Of course ! I bought two copies .,N
10,7388,"Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? __eou__",Y
0,7389,"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them .",N
1,7389,I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it .,N
2,7389,"I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ?",Y
3,7389,I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .,Y
4,7389,"No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party .",N
5,7389,"Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like .",Y
6,7389,"I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored .",N
7,7389,I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves .,Y
8,7389,Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 __eou__,N
0,7390,Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .,N
1,7390,There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .,Y
2,7390,I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .,Y
3,7390,Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net .,N
4,7390,"When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?",N
5,7390,"Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone .",N
6,7390,"When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things .",N
7,7390,"That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .",Y
8,7390,That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit .,Y
9,7390,How do I do that ?,N
10,7390,"Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again .",Y
11,7390,That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . __eou__,N
0,7391,I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans .,Y
1,7391,Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years .,N
2,7391,"I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle .",Y
3,7391,"I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .",Y
4,7391,no-one really believes gossip columnists .,N
5,7391,"I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines .",Y
6,7391,"I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people .",Y
7,7391,That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ?,Y
8,7391,"I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity .",Y
9,7391,"You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography .",Y
10,7391,"Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . __eou__",N
0,7392,Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .,N
1,7392,"Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .",N
2,7392,Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?,N
3,7392,"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !",Y
4,7392,That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?,N
5,7392,No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .,N
6,7392,"So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?",N
7,7392,I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .,Y
8,7392,"I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime !",Y
9,7392,"It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? __eou__",N
0,7393,Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?,N
1,7393,"Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean .",Y
2,7393,How often do you run your anti-virus program ?,N
3,7393,I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .,N
4,7393,Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?,N
5,7393,How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .,Y
6,7393,That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?,N
7,7393,Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .,N
8,7393,What do you use your computer for ?,N
9,7393,"I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones .",Y
10,7393,"Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some program and learn how to use them . __eou__",Y
0,7394,How often do you use the internet ?,N
1,7394,"I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ?",Y
